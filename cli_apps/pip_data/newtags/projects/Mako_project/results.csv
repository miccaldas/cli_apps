"(['Mako Templates for Python'], [""Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a\nfamiliar, non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for\nmaximum performance. Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best\nideas of many others, including Django and Jinja2 templates, Cheetah,\nMyghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded Python\n(i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar\nideas of componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of\nthe most straightforward and flexible models available, while\nalso maintaining close ties to Python calling and scoping\nsemantics."", 'Mako is used by ', ' where it delivers over ', '.\n\nIt is the default template\nlanguage included with the ', ' web frameworks.\n', ""Python is a great scripting language.

As templates are ultimately compiled into Python bytecode,\n    Mako's approach is extremely efficient, and was originally written to be\n    just as fast as Cheetah.
