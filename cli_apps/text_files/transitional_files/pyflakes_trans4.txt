descriptionA simple program which checks Python source files for errors."Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors.  It works byparsing the source file, not importing it, so it is safe to use onmodules with side effects.  It’s also much faster."It is "and it supports all active versions of Python: 2.7 and 3.4 to 3.8."descriptionA simple program which checks Python source files for errors."Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors.
