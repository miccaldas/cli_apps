description
 is a loader interface around multiple config file formats. It
exists to define a common API for applications to use when they wish to load
configuration. The library itself does not aim to handle anything except
a basic API that applications may use to find and load configuration settings.
Any specific constraints should be implemented in a pluggable loader which can
be registered via an entrypoint.
See 
 or
