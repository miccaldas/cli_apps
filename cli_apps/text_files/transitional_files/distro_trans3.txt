 provides information about the

version information.
It is the recommended replacement for Python's original


function (removed in Python 3.8). It also provides much more functionality
which isn't necessarily Python bound, like a command-line interface.
Distro currently supports Linux and BSD based systems but

An alternative implementation became necessary because Python 3.5 deprecated
this function, and Python 3.8 removed it altogether. Its predecessor function


was already deprecated since Python 2.6 and removed in Python 3.8. Still, there

namely from these data sources (from high to low precedence):
 is supported and tested on Python 3.6+ and PyPy and on any
