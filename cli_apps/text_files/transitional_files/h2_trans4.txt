description"This repository contains a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocolstack. It’s written from the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program youchoose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2 regardless of yourprogramming paradigm."You use it like this:"This repository does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or any rulesabout concurrency. Instead, it’s a purely in-memory solution, defined in termsof data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full PythonHTTP implementation.""To install it, just run:"description"This repository contains a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocolstack.
