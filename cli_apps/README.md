There are a lot of invisible steps on this project.  
Most of latter clean up tasks were not done in Python or Bash, or Sh, but in
Vim. Having discovered the 'argument list' capability, that allows you to change
a series of files in one go, I understood that this was the most expedient way
to finish that grueling and thankless job of cleaning data.  
Everything that Sed could not fix, deleting carriage return symbols, for one,
was done simply in Vim.  
If I'm happy to have find this new tool, I'm not oblivious to what we loose here
in capacity to replicate, as also loosing a lot of documental support.
