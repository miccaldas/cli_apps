Function registries are helpful\nwhen you have objects that need to be both easily serializable and fully\ncustomizable. Instead of passing a function into your object, you pass in an\nidentifier name, which the object can use to lookup the function from the\nregistry. This makes the object easy to serialize, because the name is a simple\nstring. If you instead saved the function, you'd have to use Pickle for\nserialization, which has many drawbacks."", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', ' ', ' ', ' v3.0+ is only compatible with Python 3.8+.\nFor Python 3.6+ compatibility, use ', ' v2.x and for Python 2.7+\ncompatibility, use ', ' v1.x.', ""Let's imagine you're developing a Python package that needs to load data\nsomewhere.
