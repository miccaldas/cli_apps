,The online HTML version of these docs:
,Examples are in the ""related pages"" tab of the HTML docs.,In brief, TinyXML-2 parses an XML document, and builds from that a
Document Object Model (DOM) that can be read, modified, and saved.,XML stands for ""eXtensible Markup Language."" It is a general purpose
human and machine readable markup language to describe arbitrary data.
All those random file formats created to store application data can
all be replaced with XML. One parser for everything.,There are different ways to access and interact with XML data.
TinyXML-2 uses a Document Object Model (DOM), meaning the XML data is parsed
into a C++ objects that can be browsed and manipulated, and then
written to disk or another output stream. You can also construct an XML document
from scratch with C++ objects and write this to disk or another output
stream. You can even use TinyXML-2 to stream XML programmatically from
code without creating a document first.,TinyXML-2 is designed to be easy and fast to learn. It is one header and
one cpp file. Simply add these to your project and off you go.
There is an example file - xmltest.cpp - to get you started.,TinyXML-2 is released under the ZLib license,
so you can use it in open source or commercial code. The details
of the license are at the top of every source file.,TinyXML-2 attempts to be a flexible parser, but with truly correct and
compliant XML output. TinyXML-2 should compile on any reasonably C++
compliant system. It does not rely on exceptions, RTTI, or the STL.,TinyXML-2 doesn't parse or use DTDs (Document Type Definitions) or XSLs
(eXtensible Stylesheet Language.) There are other parsers out there
that are much more fully featured. But they are generally bigger and
more difficult to use. If you are working with
browsers or have more complete XML needs, TinyXML-2 is not the parser for you.,TinyXML-2 long been the focus of all development. It is well tested
and should be used instead of TinyXML-1.,TinyXML-2 uses a similar API to TinyXML-1 and the same
rich test cases. But the implementation of the parser is completely re-written
to make it more appropriate for use in a game. It uses less memory, is faster,
and uses far fewer memory allocations.,TinyXML-2 has no requirement or support for STL.,TinyXML-2 uses UTF-8 exclusively when interpreting XML. All XML is assumed to
be UTF-8.,Filenames for loading / saving are passed unchanged to the underlying OS.,An XMLDocument is a C++ object like any other, that can be on the stack, or
new'd and deleted on the heap.,However, any sub-node of the Document, XMLElement, XMLText, etc, can only
be created by calling the appropriate XMLDocument::NewElement, NewText, etc.
method. Although you have pointers to these objects, they are still owned
by the Document. When the Document is deleted, so are all the nodes it contains.,Microsoft has an excellent article on white space: ,By default, TinyXML-2 preserves white space in a (hopefully) sane way that is almost compliant with the
spec. (TinyXML-1 used a completely different model, much more similar to 'collapse', below.),As a first step, all newlines / carriage-returns / line-feeds are normalized to a
line-feed character, as required by the XML spec.,White space in text is preserved. For example:,The leading space before the ""Hello"" and the double space after the comma are
preserved. Line-feeds are preserved, as in this example:,However, white space between elements is , preserved. Although not strictly
compliant, tracking and reporting inter-element space is awkward, and not normally
valuable. TinyXML-2 sees these as the same XML:,For some applications, it is preferable to collapse whitespace. Collapsing
whitespace gives you ""HTML-like"" behavior, which is sometimes more suitable
for hand typed documents.,TinyXML-2 supports this with the 'whitespace' parameter to the XMLDocument constructor.
(The default is to preserve whitespace, as described above.),However, you may also use COLLAPSE_WHITESPACE, which will:,Note that (currently) there is a performance impact for using COLLAPSE_WHITESPACE.
It essentially causes the XML to be parsed twice.,TinyXML-2 reports the line number of any errors in an XML document that
cannot be parsed correctly. In addition, all nodes (elements, declarations,
text, comments etc.) and attributes have a line number recorded as they are parsed.
This allows an application that performs additional validation of the parsed
XML document (e.g. application-implemented DTD validation) to report
line number information for error messages.,TinyXML-2 recognizes the pre-defined ""character entities"", meaning special
characters. Namely:,These are recognized when the XML document is read, and translated to their
UTF-8 equivalents. For instance, text with the XML of:,will have the Value() of ""Far & Away"" when queried from the XMLText object,
and will be written back to the XML stream/file as an ampersand.,Additionally, any character can be specified by its Unicode code point:
The syntax , or , are both to the non-breaking space character.
This is called a 'numeric character reference'. Any numeric character reference
that isn't one of the special entities above, will be read, but written as a
regular code point. The output is correct, but the entity syntax isn't preserved.,You can directly use the convenience function:,Or the XMLPrinter class:,Printing to memory is supported by the XMLPrinter.,When loading, an XML parser is very useful. However, sometimes
when saving, it just gets in the way. The code is often set up
for streaming, and constructing the DOM is just overhead.,The Printer supports the streaming case. The following code
prints out a trivially simple XML file without ever creating
an XML document.,There are 2 files in TinyXML-2:,And additionally a test file:,Generally speaking, the intent is that you simply include the tinyxml2.cpp and
tinyxml2.h files in your project and build with your other source code.,There is also a CMake build included. CMake is the general build for TinyXML-2.
Additional build systems are costly to maintain, and tend to bit-rot.,A Visual Studio project is included, but that is largely for developer convenience,
and is not intended to integrate well with other builds.,You can download and install TinyXML-2 using the , dependency manager:,The TinyXML-2 port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please , on the vcpkg repository.,TinyXML-2 uses semantic versioning. , Releases are now tagged in github.,Note that the major version will (probably) change fairly rapidly.

from scratch with C++ objects and write this to disk or another output

(eXtensible Stylesheet Language.) There are other parsers out there

text, comments etc.) and attributes have a line number recorded as they are parsed.
This allows an application that performs additional validation of the parsed
XML document (e.g. application-implemented DTD validation) to report
line number information for error messages.,TinyXML-2 recognizes the pre-defined ""character entities"", meaning special

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,TinyXML-2 is a simple, small, efficient, C++ XML parser that can be
easily integrated into other programs.,The master is hosted on github:
,The online HTML version of these docs:
,Examples are in the ""related pages"" tab of the HTML docs.,In brief, TinyXML-2 parses an XML document, and builds from that a
Document Object Model (DOM) that can be read, modified, and saved.,XML stands for ""eXtensible Markup Language."" It is a general purpose
human and machine readable markup language to describe arbitrary data.
All those random file formats created to store application data can
all be replaced with XML. One parser for everything.,There are different ways to access and interact with XML data.
TinyXML-2 uses a Document Object Model (DOM), meaning the XML data is parsed
into a C++ objects that can be browsed and manipulated, and then
written to disk or another output stream. You can also construct an XML document
from scratch with C++ objects and write this to disk or another output
stream. You can even use TinyXML-2 to stream XML programmatically from
code without creating a document first.,TinyXML-2 is designed to be easy and fast to learn. It is one header and
one cpp file. Simply add these to your project and off you go.
There is an example file - xmltest.cpp - to get you started.,TinyXML-2 is released under the ZLib license,
so you can use it in open source or commercial code. The details
of the license are at the top of every source file.,TinyXML-2 attempts to be a flexible parser, but with truly correct and
compliant XML output. TinyXML-2 should compile on any reasonably C++
compliant system. It does not rely on exceptions, RTTI, or the STL.,TinyXML-2 doesn't parse or use DTDs (Document Type Definitions) or XSLs
(eXtensible Stylesheet Language.) There are other parsers out there
that are much more fully featured. But they are generally bigger and
more difficult to use. If you are working with
browsers or have more complete XML needs, TinyXML-2 is not the parser for you.,TinyXML-2 long been the focus of all development. It is well tested
and should be used instead of TinyXML-1.,TinyXML-2 uses a similar API to TinyXML-1 and the same
rich test cases. But the implementation of the parser is completely re-written
to make it more appropriate for use in a game. It uses less memory, is faster,
and uses far fewer memory allocations.,TinyXML-2 has no requirement or support for STL.,TinyXML-2 uses UTF-8 exclusively when interpreting XML. All XML is assumed to
be UTF-8.,Filenames for loading / saving are passed unchanged to the underlying OS.,An XMLDocument is a C++ object like any other, that can be on the stack, or
new'd and deleted on the heap.,However, any sub-node of the Document, XMLElement, XMLText, etc, can only
be created by calling the appropriate XMLDocument::NewElement, NewText, etc.
method. Although you have pointers to these objects, they are still owned
by the Document. When the Document is deleted, so are all the nodes it contains.,Microsoft has an excellent article on white space: ,By default, TinyXML-2 preserves white space in a (hopefully) sane way that is almost compliant with the
spec. (TinyXML-1 used a completely different model, much more similar to 'collapse', below.),As a first step, all newlines / carriage-returns / line-feeds are normalized to a
line-feed character, as required by the XML spec.,White space in text is preserved. For example:,The leading space before the ""Hello"" and the double space after the comma are
preserved. Line-feeds are preserved, as in this example:,However, white space between elements is , preserved. Although not strictly
compliant, tracking and reporting inter-element space is awkward, and not normally
valuable. TinyXML-2 sees these as the same XML:,For some applications, it is preferable to collapse whitespace. Collapsing
whitespace gives you ""HTML-like"" behavior, which is sometimes more suitable
for hand typed documents.,TinyXML-2 supports this with the 'whitespace' parameter to the XMLDocument constructor.
(The default is to preserve whitespace, as described above.),However, you may also use COLLAPSE_WHITESPACE, which will:,Note that (currently) there is a performance impact for using COLLAPSE_WHITESPACE.
It essentially causes the XML to be parsed twice.,TinyXML-2 reports the line number of any errors in an XML document that
cannot be parsed correctly. In addition, all nodes (elements, declarations,

,Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.,Works on 3.7+.,A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use
, with tag ,.,Create and activate your virtual environment, then:,If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the “Unreleased” section
of the ,.,Linux 2.6 (inotify),macOS (FSEvents, kqueue),FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue),Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.

,Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.,Works on 3.7+.,A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use
, with tag ,.,Create and activate your virtual environment, then:,If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the “Unreleased” section
of the ,.,Linux 2.6 (inotify),macOS (FSEvents, kqueue),FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue),Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.

,Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.,Works on 3.7+.,A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use
, with tag ,.,Create and activate your virtual environment, then:,If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the “Unreleased” section
of the ,.,Linux 2.6 (inotify),macOS (FSEvents, kqueue),FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue),Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.

,Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.,Works on 3.7+.,A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use
, with tag ,.,Create and activate your virtual environment, then:,If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the “Unreleased” section
of the ,.,Linux 2.6 (inotify),macOS (FSEvents, kqueue),FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue),Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.

,Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.,Works on 3.7+.,A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use

ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.

,Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.,Works on 3.7+.,A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use
, with tag ,.,Create and activate your virtual environment, then:,If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the “Unreleased” section
of the ,.,Linux 2.6 (inotify),macOS (FSEvents, kqueue),FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue),Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.

as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use
, with tag ,.,Create and activate your virtual environment, then:,If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the “Unreleased” section
of the ,.,Linux 2.6 (inotify),macOS (FSEvents, kqueue),FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue),Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.

,Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events.,Works on 3.7+.,A simple program that uses watchdog to monitor directories specified
as command-line arguments and logs events generated:,Watchdog comes with an , utility script called ,.
Please type , at the shell prompt to
know more about this tool.,Here is how you can log the current directory recursively
for events related only to , and , files while
ignoring all directory events:,You can use the , subcommand to execute shell commands in
response to events:,Please see the help information for these commands by typing:, can read , files and execute tricks within them in
response to file system events. Tricks are actually event handlers that
subclass , and are written by plugin authors. Trick
classes are augmented with a few additional features that regular event handlers
don’t need.,An example , file:,The directory containing the , file will be monitored. Each trick
class is initialized with its corresponding keys in the , file as
arguments and events are fed to an instance of this class as they arrive.,Install from PyPI using ,:,Install from source:,You can browse the latest release , online.,Fork the , on GitHub and send a pull request, or file an issue
ticket at the ,. For general help and questions use
, with tag ,.,Create and activate your virtual environment, then:,If you are making a substantial change, add an entry to the “Unreleased” section
of the ,.,Linux 2.6 (inotify),macOS (FSEvents, kqueue),FreeBSD/BSD (kqueue),Windows (ReadDirectoryChangesW with I/O completion ports;
ReadDirectoryChangesW worker threads),OS-independent (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them
periodically; slow and not recommended),Note that when using watchdog with kqueue, you need the
number of file descriptors allowed to be opened by programs
running on your system to be increased to more than the
number of files that you will be monitoring. The easiest way
to do that is to edit your , file and add
a line similar to:,This is an inherent problem with kqueue because it uses
file descriptors to monitor files. That plus the enormous
amount of bookkeeping that watchdog needs to do in order
to monitor file descriptors just makes this a painful way
to monitor files and directories. In essence, kqueue is
not a very scalable way to monitor a deeply nested
directory of files and directories with a large number of
files.,Vim does not modify files unless directed to do so.
It creates backup files and then swaps them in to replace
the files you are editing on the disk. This means that
if you use Vim to edit your files, the on-modified events
for those files will not be triggered by watchdog.
You may need to configure Vim appropriately to disable
this feature.,When you want to watch changes in CIFS, you need to explicitly tell watchdog to
use ,, that is, instead of letting watchdog decide an
appropriate observer like in the example above, do:,Python 3.7 or above., (only on macOS when installing from sources), (only for ,),Watchdog is licensed under the terms of the ,.,Copyright 2011 ,.,Copyright 2012 Google, Inc & contributors.,Project , is available at Github.
