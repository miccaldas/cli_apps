GNU libmicrohttpd is a small C library that makes it
easy to run an HTTP server as part of another application.
GNU Libmicrohttpd is free software and part of the ,.  Key features that distinguish
GNU Libmicrohttpd from other projects are:
,
GNU libmicrohttpd was started because the author needed an easy way to add
a concurrent HTTP server to other projects.  Existing alternatives
were either non-free, not reentrant, standalone, of terrible code
quality, or a combination thereof.  Do not use GNU libmicrohttpd if you are
looking for a standalone HTTP server, there are many other projects
out there that provide that kind of functionality already.  However,
if you want to be able to serve simple WWW pages from within your C or
C++ application, check it out.
,
  Latest release is ,.
,
In addition to the brief documentation on this webpage, we
have various other forms of documentation available:
,Libmicrohttpd uses the
,
mailinglist to discuss all aspects of
Libmicrohttpd,
including support, development, and enhancement requests, as well as bug reports.
,Announcements about
Libmicrohttpd
and most other GNU software are made on
,
(,).
,
Security reports that should not be made immediately public can be
sent directly to ,.  If there is no response to an urgent issue, you can
escalate to the general
,
mailing list for advice.,Development of
Libmicrohttpd,
and GNU in general, is a volunteer effort, and you can contribute.  For
information, please read ,.  If you'd
like to get involved, it's a good idea to join the discussion mailing
list (see above).,You can access the current development version of libmicrohttpd using,Our website is kept at,
The following is a minimal example for GNU/Linux (included in the distribution):
,
The second threading mode, ,, uses
only a single thread to handle listening on the port and processing of
requests.  This mode is preferable if spawning a thread for each
connection would be costly.  If the HTTP server is able to quickly
produce responses without much computational overhead for each
connection, this mode can be a great choice.  Note that MHD will
still start a single thread for itself – this way, the main program
can continue with its operations after calling ,.
Naturally, if the HTTP server needs to interact with
shared state in the main application, synchronization will be
required.  If such synchronization in code providing a response
results in blocking, all HTTP server operations on all connections
will stall.  This mode is a bad choice if response data (for responses
generated using the ,
function) cannot always be provided instantly.  The reason is that the
code generating responses should not block (since that would block all
other connections) and on the other hand, if response data is not
available immediately, MHD will start to busy wait on it.  Use the
first mode if you want to block on providing response data in the
callback, or the last mode if you want to use a more event-driven
mode with one big select loop.
,
The third mode combines a thread pool with
the , mode, which can benefit
implementations that require scalability. As said before, by default
this mode only uses a single thread.  When combined with the thread pool option, it
is possible to handle multiple connections with multiple threads.  The
number of threads is specified using the
,; any value greater than one for
this option will activate the use of the thread pool.  In contrast to
the , mode (where each thread
handles one and only one connection), threads in the pool can handle a
large number of concurrent connections.  Using
, in combination with a thread pool
is typically the most scalable (but also hardest to debug) mode of
operation for MHD.
,
The fourth threading mode (used when no specific flag is given), uses
no threads.  Instead, the main application must (periodically) request
file descriptor sets from MHD, perform a select call and then call
,.  , will then process HTTP requests as
usual and return.  , is guaranteed to not block;
however, access handlers and response processing callbacks that it
invokes may block.  This mode is useful if a single-threaded
implementation is desired and in particular if the main application
already uses a select loop for its processing.  If the application is
not ready to provide a response, it can just return zero for the
number of bytes read and use its file descriptors in the external
select loop to wake up and continue once the data is ready – MHD will
unlist the socket from the write set if the application failed to
provide response data (this only happens in this mode).
,
The testcases provided include examples for using each of the
threading modes.
,
A response is used by calling , which sends
the response back to the client on the specified connection.  Once
created, a response object can be used any number of times.
Internally, each response uses a reference counter.  The response is
freed once the reference counter reaches zero.  The HTTP server should
call , when a response object is no longer
needed, that is, the server will not call ,
again using this response object.  Note that this does not mean that
the response will be immediately destroyed – destruction may be
delayed until sending of the response is complete on all connections
that have the response in the queue.
,
The callback function for the respective URL will be called at least
twice.  The first call happens after the server has received the
headers.  The client should use the last , argument to
store internal context for the session.  The first call to the
callback function is mostly for this type of initialization and for
internal access checks.  At least, the callback function should
""remember"" that the first call with just the headers has
happened.  Queueing a response during the first call (for a given
connection) should only be used for errors – if the client queues a
response during this first call, a ""100 CONTINUE"" response will
be suppressed, the request body will not be read and the connection
will be closed after sending the response.  After the first call, the
callback function will be called with upload data.  Until
, is zero, the callback may not queue a
response, any such attempt will fail.  The callback function should
update , to indicate how many bytes were
processed.  Depending on available buffer space, incremental
processing of the upload maybe required.  Once all of the upload data
has been processed, MHD will call the callback a second time with
, being zero.  At this point, the callback
should queue a ""normal"" response.  If queueing a response is
not possible, the callback may either block or simply not queue a
response depending on the threading mode that is used.  If the
callback does not queue a response at this point, MHD will either
(eventually) timeout the connection or keep calling it.

libdv,"Welcome.  The ,
    DV codec (libdv) is a software codec for DV video, the encoding
    format used by most digital camcorders, typically those that
    support the IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. FireWire or i.Link) interface.
    Libdv was developed according to the official standards for DV
    video: IEC 61834 and SMPTE 314M.

    ,    
    This software was developed by:
    ,
    The project was started while we were both members of the 
    , 
    at the 
    ,.  
    Erik is now a independent developer, active in numerous open source projects.
    Buck is now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science 
    at the University of British Columbia.

    ,
    A number of people have made significant contributions the libdv
    source code.  See the ,
    file for the current list. 

    ,
    I consider libdv to be in beta for 1.0 release.  There are now several 
    projects using libdv.
    ,
    Libdv can decode most DV streams, and has a fairly mature encoder.  
    A fair amount of x86 optimized
    code is in place, although I estimate we are still 2-3x slower than
    the best commercial software codecs.   
    ,
    There are a number of sample applications included with libdv, including
    , and ,.
    ,
    Not much, yet.  Documentation is the most important pending
    task for reaching 1.0.  

    ,SourceForge hosts several libdv 
    ,.
    
    ,
      Those seriously interested in working with the code will want to
      acquire the standards documents, but we can't provide them
      because they're not free.  SMPTE 314M is sufficient and
      reasonably priced.  It is available from 
      , for about $34 USD.
    ,
       Sony has freely-available document called
      , 
      that provides many of the details from the
      standards.  DVCAM differs from regular DV in the physical tape,
      the compression format is unchanged.  This should help a great
      deal in understanding libdv source code.
    ,
    The current release is available at our 
    ,
    summary page on ,.
    ,
      We also have a sample 
      , 
      for testing purposes.  Be warned:
      this file is ,, about 105MB.  For the curious, this
      file was captured with a Canon Elura camcorder (now discontinued).  The camera was
      operating in its progressive-scan mode, which is better suited
      to computer display.  The scene is of a popular duck-pond (for
      the ducks anyway) here on OGI's campus.
    ,
    Arne Schirmacher maintains an excellent
    , 
    page.
    ,
    For general information on DV, , 
    is a good place to start.
    ,
    Please note that this software is only concerned with the
    DV video compression format, which is different from capturing the
    data from a camcorder.  Most DV camcorders have an interface which
    can be connected to an IEEE 1394 (aka ""Firewire"") interface in a
    computer.  See Arne's page for pointers to 1394 related software.

It is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to ,.
While it does not aim to support all of ,'s powerful functionality, it provides sensible
(opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.,Quick links:,First, to get an overview of all available command line options, you can either run
, for a concise help message or , for a more detailed
version., is designed to find entries in your filesystem. The most basic search you can perform is to
run , with a single argument: the search pattern. For example, assume that you want to find an
old script of yours (the name included ,):,If called with just a single argument like this, , searches the current directory recursively
for any entries that , the pattern ,.,The search pattern is treated as a regular expression. Here, we search for entries that start
with , and end with ,:,The regular expression syntax used by , is ,.,If we want to search a specific directory, it can be given as a second argument to ,:, can be called with no arguments. This is very useful to get a quick overview of all entries
in the current directory, recursively (similar to ,):,If you want to use this functionality to list all files in a given directory, you have to use
a catch-all pattern such as , or ,:,Often, we are interested in all files of a particular type. This can be done with the , (or
,) option. Here, we search for all Markdown files in the fd repository:,The , option can be used in combination with a search pattern:,To find files with exactly the provided search pattern, use the , (or ,) option:,By default, , does not search hidden directories and does not show hidden files in the
search results. To disable this behavior, we can use the , (or ,) option:,If we work in a directory that is a Git repository (or includes Git repositories), , does not
search folders (and does not show files) that match one of the , patterns. To disable
this behavior, we can use the , (or ,) option:,To really search , files and directories, simply combine the hidden and ignore features to show
everything (,).,By default, , only matches the filename of each file. However, using the , or , option,
you can match against the full path.,Instead of just showing the search results, you often want to , with them. ,
provides two ways to execute external commands for each of your search results:,Recursively find all zip archives and unpack them:,If there are two such files, , and ,, this would execute
, and ,. The two , processes run in parallel
(if the files are found fast enough).,Find all , and , files and auto-format them inplace with ,:,Note how the , option to , can be passed as a separate argument. This is why
we put the , option last.,Find all , files and open them in your favorite editor:,Note that we use capital , here to open a single , instance. If there are two such files,
, and ,, this will run ,.,To see details like file permissions, owners, file sizes etc., you can tell , to show them
by running , for each result:,This pattern is so useful that , provides a shortcut. You can use the ,/,
option to execute , in this way: ,.,The , option is also useful when combining , with , (,) in order to search within a certain class of files, like all C++ source files:,Convert all , files to , files:,Here, , is a placeholder for the search result. , is the same, without the file extension.
See below for more details on the placeholder syntax.,The terminal output of commands run from parallel threads using , will not be interlaced or garbled,
so , can be used to rudimentarily parallelize a task run over many files.
An example of this is calculating the checksum of each individual file within a directory.,The , and , options take a , as a series of arguments (instead of a single string).
If you want to add additional options to , after the command template, you can terminate it with a ,.,The syntax for generating commands is similar to that of ,:,If you do not include a placeholder, , automatically adds a , at the end.,For ,/,, you can control the number of parallel jobs by using the ,/, option.
Use , for serial execution.,Sometimes we want to ignore search results from a specific subdirectory. For example, we might
want to search all hidden files and directories (,) but exclude all matches from ,
directories. We can use the , (or ,) option for this. It takes an arbitrary glob
pattern as an argument:,We can also use this to skip mounted directories:,.. or to skip certain file types:,To make exclude-patterns like these permanent, you can create a , file. They work like
, files, but are specific to ,. For example:,Note: , also supports , files that are used by other programs such as , or ,.,If you want , to ignore these patterns globally, you can put them in ,'s global ignore file.
This is usually located in , in macOS or Linux, and , in
Windows.,You can use , to remove all files and directories that are matched by your search pattern.
If you only want to remove files, you can use the ,/, option to call ,. For
example, to recursively remove all , files, run:,If you are unsure, always call , without , first. Alternatively, use ,s ""interactive""
option:,If you also want to remove a certain class of directories, you can use the same technique. You will
have to use ,s ,/, flag to remove directories.,Note: there are scenarios where using , can cause race conditions: if you have a
path like , and want to remove all directories named ,, you can end up in a
situation where the outer , directory is removed first, leading to (harmless) , errors in the , call.,This is the output of ,. To see the full set of command-line options, use , which
also includes a much more detailed help text.,Let's search my home folder for files that end in ,. It contains ~190.000
subdirectories and about a million files. For averaging and statistical analysis, I'm using
,. The following benchmarks are performed
with a ""warm""/pre-filled disk-cache (results for a ""cold"" disk-cache show the same trends).,Let's start with ,:, is much faster if it does not need to perform a regular-expression search:,Now let's try the same for ,. Note that , , performs a regular expression
search. The options , and , are needed for a fair comparison,
otherwise , does not have to traverse hidden folders and ignored paths (see below):,For this particular example, , is approximately nine times faster than ,
and about five times faster than ,. By the way, both tools found the exact
same 20880 files ,.,Finally, let's run , without , and , (this can lead to different
search results, of course). If , does not have to traverse the hidden and git-ignored
folders, it is almost an order of magnitude faster:,: This is , benchmark on , machine. While I have
performed quite a lot of different tests (and found consistent results), things might
be different for you! I encourage everyone to try it out on their own. See
, for all necessary scripts.,Concerning ,'s speed, the main credit goes to the , and , crates that are also used
in , (check it out!)., can colorize files by extension, just like ,. In order for this to work, the environment
variable , has to be set. Typically, the value
of this variable is set by the , command which provides a convenient configuration format
to define colors for different file formats.
On most distributions, , should be set already. If you are on Windows or if you are looking
for alternative, more complete (or more colorful) variants, see ,,

,., also honors the , environment variable.,Remember that , ignores hidden directories and files by default. It also ignores patterns
from , files. If you want to make sure to find absolutely every possible file, always
use the options , and , to disable these two features:,A lot of special regex characters (like ,, ,, ,, ..) are also special characters in your
shell. If in doubt, always make sure to put single quotes around the regex pattern:,If your pattern starts with a dash, you have to add , to signal the end of command line
options. Otherwise, the pattern will be interpreted as a command-line option. Alternatively,

        It allows easy use of sophisticated DVD navigation features such as DVD menus,
        multiangle playback and even interactive DVD games. All this functionality is
        provided through a simple API which provides the DVD playback as a single
        logical stream of blocks, intermitted by special dvdnav events to report certain

Is a seperate file which is translated from Nameslist.txt and was outdated for
a period of time but was recently updated by a group of developers who have
updated it up to version 14. Contributors to that file are listed in that file.,These libraries contain very large (sparse) arrays with one entry for each
unicode code point (U+0000–U+10FFFF). Each entry contains two strings, a name
and an annotation. Either or both may be NULL. Both libraries also contain a
(much smaller) list of all the Unicode blocks.,To keep both libraries slightly smaller, the beginning of lines starting with
TAB can be expanded with UTF-8 character substitutions as defined below:,With the default configure option chosen, this package will install one library
file, one header file, and one library man file. The library is 'libuninameslist',
and the header is ,. You can access these twenty-six functions:,and for backwards compatibility for older programs that still use it, there is:,while the annotation string is:,The name string is in ASCII, while the annotation string is in UTF-8 and is
also intended to be modified slightly by having any , characters which

character, etc.,If you choose to install the second library as well, then you will need to
use: './configure --enable-frenchlib',This library maintains the same 'name' and 'annot' structure, but has function
names with FR so that it is possible to open both libraries at the same time.
The header file for the French library is ,This library will also be linked to the main libuninameslist so that it can
be used through the main library (as lang=1) for functions 16 to 26.,NOTE: If you ran 'make' after running './configure' earlier, you may need to
run 'make clean' to clear-out the earlier libuninameslist library, which is
built without knowledge of the additional library.,for users with smaller systems, or want slightly smaller libraries and have
strip available, you can run:,Download a tagged release version from ,or download the latest HEAD from github:,Then build and install the library,NOTE: Some Distros and Operating Systems may require you to run 'ldconfig' to
recognize LibUniNamesList if you are not rebooting your computer first before
loading another program that depends on LibUniNamesList. To do this, you may
need to run 'ldconfig' in 'su -' mode after you have done 'make install':,NOTE: Users who do not have autoconf and automake available will want to
download the '-dist-' version found in the releases directory.,The French library was build as a separate library to maintain backwards with
older (...2012) versions of FontForge. If you want to add libuninameslist-fr,

was now installed and visible with -luninameslist-fr when you checked.
Another example, the ARM platform complained of an error with 'make' but was
fine with the later steps of 'make install' and then also 'make check'.,The explanation for this odd 'make' behaviour is that we are building two
libraries at the same time, where the uninameslist library also depends
on the French library, while at the same time older programs (like older
FontForge) would load these independently (the dependency is to allow for
substitutions if/where/when necessary).,A 'uninameslist.py' Python wrapper is provided for users that want quick
NamesList.txt access using python. To do this, you need to first build and
install the library, and then next, install the python wrapper.,The build system can optionally also build installable wheels of the package.
To do this, pass ,. Optionally, also set the , environment
variable to configure which python to use. The configured python must have ,,
, and the , packages installed.,Note, some operating systems may need to use './configure --prefix=/usr',The Python wrapper exposes the following library functions and symbols:,Blocks can be iterated over to yield all characters encoded in them.,

libassuan,"
, is a small library implementing the so-called ,. This protocol is used for IPC between most newer GnuPG
components. Both, server and client side functions are provided.
,
In an ideal world, Assuan is irrelevant. Assuan's primary use is to
allow a client to interact with a non-persistent server. Using
Assuan, this is accomplished by forking a subprocess and
communicating with it via, for example, a pipe or unix domain
socket. This method is neither elegant nor efficient especially when
there is a lot of data spread across several transactions: not only
is there a penalty for an increased number of context switches, but
also a significant amount of data is memcpy-ed from the client to a
file descriptor and from the file descriptor to the server. Despite
these and other disadvantages, this type of client/server
communication can be useful: the client is completely separate from
the server; they are in different address spaces. This is especially
important in situations where the server must have a known degree of
reliability and data must be protected: as the Assuan protocol is
well defined and clients cannot corrupt the servers' address space,
auditing become much easier.
,
Assuan was developed for use by the GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, to
prevent potentially buggy clients from unwittingly corrupting
sensitive transactions or compromising data such as a secret
key. Assuan permits the servers, which do the actual work,
e.g. encryption and decryption of data using a secret key, to be
developed independently of the user interfaces, e.g. mail clients
and other encryption front ends. Like a shared library, the
interface is well defined and any number of front ends can use it;
however, unlike a shared library, the client cannot see or touch the
server's data. As with any modular system, Assuan helps keep the
servers small and understandable, and helps to make code more
understandable and less error prone.
,
Assuan is not, however, limited to use with GnuPG servers and
clients: it was design to be flexible enough to meet the demands of
almost any transaction based environment with non-persistent
servers.

,GNU Diffutils is a package of several programs related to finding
differences between files.,Computer users often find occasion to ask how two files differ.
Perhaps one file is a newer version of the other file.  Or maybe the two
files started out as identical copies but were changed by different
people.,You can use the , command to show differences between
two files, or each corresponding file in two directories.
, outputs differences between files line by line in any
of several formats, selectable by command line options. This set of
differences is often called a “diff” or
“patch”. For files that are identical, ,
normally produces no output; for binary (non-text) files,
, normally reports only that they are different.,You can use the , command to show the offsets and line
numbers where two files differ. , can also show all the
characters that differ between the two files, side by side.,You can use the , command to show differences among
three files. When two people have made independent changes to a common
original, , can report the differences between the
original and the two changed versions, and can produce a merged file
that contains both persons' changes together with warnings about
conflicts.,You can use the , command to merge two files
interactively.,

The `time' command runs another program, then displays information
about the resources used by that program.
,
Often your shell (e.g. bash, zsh) will have its own , version
of 'time' which takes precedence over GNU time.
Use 'type' to determine whether time is a built-in keyword or not.
Use 'env' or absolute path to force using the 'time' binary.

directly and do not use this layer.,If you absolutely must have the real SDL 1.2 (""SDL 1.2 Classic""), please use
the source tree at ,, which occasionally
gets bug fixes but no formal release. But we strongly encourage you not to do
that.,Build the library. This will need access to SDL2's headers (v2.0.7 or newer),
, and the build tools of your choice. Once built, you
will have a drop-in replacement that can be used with any existing binary
that relies on SDL 1.2. You can copy this library over the existing 1.2 build,
or force it to take priority over a system copy with LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.
At runtime, sdl12-compat needs to be able to find a copy of SDL2 (v2.0.7 or
newer -- v2.0.12 or newer for Windows), so plan to include it with the library
if necessary.,If you want to build an SDL 1.2 program from source code, we have included
compatibility headers, so that sdl12-compat can completely replace SDL 1.2
at all points. These headers are just the bare minimum needed for source-level
compatibility and don't have a lot of documentation or fanciness at all. The
new headers are also under the zlib license. Note that sdl12-compat itself
does not use these headers, so if you just want the library, you don't need
them.,These are quick-start instructions; there isn't anything out of the ordinary
here if you're used to using CMake.,You'll need to use CMake to build sdl12-compat. Download at
, or install from your package manager
(, on Ubuntu, etc).,Please refer to the ,
for complete details, as platform and build tool details vary.,You'll need a copy of SDL 2.0.x to build sdl12-compat, because we need the
SDL2 headers. You can build this from source or install from a package
manager. Windows and Mac users can download prebuilt binaries from
,; make sure you
get the ""development libraries"" and not ""runtime binaries"" there.,Linux users might need some packages from their Linux distribution. On Ubuntu,
you might need to do:,Now just point CMake at sdl12-compat's directory. Here's a command-line
example:,On Windows or macOS, you might prefer to use CMake's GUI, but it's the same
idea: give it the directory where sdl12-compat is located, click ""Configure,""
choose your favorite compiler, then click ""Generate."" Now you have project
files! Click ""Open Project"" to launch your development environment. Then you
can build however you like with Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.,If necessary, you might have to fill in the location of the SDL2 headers
when using CMake. sdl12-compat does not need SDL2's library to ,,
just its headers (although it may complain about the missing library,
you can ignore that). From the command line, add
,, or find this in the CMake
GUI and set it appropriately, click ""Configure"" again, and then ""Generate."",When the build is complete, you'll have a shared library you can drop in
as a replacement for an existing SDL 1.2 build. This will also build
the original SDL 1.2 test apps, so you can verify the library is working.,There are a lot of binaries from many years ago that used SDL 1.2, which is
to say they are for CPU architectures that are likely not your current
system's.,If you want to build a 32-bit x86 library on an x86-64 Linux machine, for
compatibility with older games, you should install some basic 32-bit
development libraries for your distribution. On Ubuntu, this would be:,...and then add , to your build options:,macOS users can try adding , instead
of , to make a Universal Binary for both 64-bit Intel and
Apple Silicon machines. If you have an older (or much older!) version of Xcode,
you can try to build with ""i386"" or maybe even ""powerpc"" for 32-bit Intel or
PowerPC systems, but Xcode (and macOS itself) has not supported either of
these for quite some time, and you will likely struggle to get SDL2 to compile
here in small ways, as well...but with some effort, it's maybe , to
run SDL2 and sdl12-compat on Apple's abandoned architectures.,Windows users just select a 32-bit version of Visual Studio when running
CMake, when it asks you what compiler to target in the CMake GUI.,sdl12-compat has a number of configuration options which can be used to work
around issues with individual applications, or to better fit your system or
preferences.,These options are all specified as environment variables, and can be set by
running your application with them set on the command-line, for example:,will run , with high-dpi monitor support enabled, but OpenGL
scaling support disabled.,(While these environment variables are checked at various times throughout
the lifetime of the app, sdl12-compat expects these to be set before the
process starts and not change during the life of the process, and any
places where changing it later might affect operation is purely accidental
and might change. That is to say: don't write an SDL 1.2-based app with
plans to tweak these values on the fly!),The available options are:,SDL12COMPAT_DEBUG_LOGGING: (checked at startup)
If enabled, print debugging messages to stderr.  These messages are
mostly useful to developers, or when trying to track down a specific
bug.,SDL12COMPAT_FAKE_CDROM_PATH: (checked during SDL_Init)
A path to a directory containing MP3 files (named trackXX.mp3, where
XX is a two-digit track number) to be used by applications which play
CD audio.  Using an absolute path is recommended: relative paths are
not guaranteed to work correctly.,SDL12COMPAT_OPENGL_SCALING: (checked during SDL_Init)
Enables scaling of OpenGL applications to the current desktop resolution.
If disabled, applications can change the real screen resolution.  This
option is enabled by default, but not all applications are compatible
with it: try changing this if you can only see a black screen.,SDL12COMPAT_FIX_BORDERLESS_FS_WIN: (checked during SDL_SetVideoMode)
Enables turning borderless windows at the desktop resolution into actual
fullscreen windows (so they'll go into a separate space on macOS and
properly hide dock windows on other desktop environments, etc).
If disabled, applications may not get the full display to theirselves as
they expect. This option is enabled by default, but this option is here
so it can be manually disabled, in case this causes some negative result
we haven't anticipated.,SDL12COMPAT_SCALE_METHOD: (checked during SDL_Init)
Choose the scaling method used when applications render at a non-native
resolution.  The options are ,, for nearest-neighbour sampling
(more pixelated) and , for bilinear sampling (blurrier).,SDL12COMPAT_HIGHDPI: (checked during SDL_SetVideoMode)
Advertise the application as supporting high-DPI displays.  Enabling
this will usually result in sharper graphics, but on some applications
text and other elements may become very small.,SDL12COMPAT_SYNC_TO_VBLANK: (checked during SDL_SetVideoMode)
Force the application to sync (or not sync) to the vertical blanking
interval (VSync).  When enabled, this will cap the application's
framerate to the screen's refresh rate (and may resolve issues with
screen tearing).,SDL12COMPAT_USE_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT: (checked during SDL_Init)
Make all keyboard input take the current keyboard layout into account.
This may need to be disabled for applications which provide their own
keyboard layout support, or if the position of the keys on the keyboard
is more important than the character they produce.  Note that text input
(in most applications) will take the keyboard layout into account
regardless of this option.,SDL12COMPAT_USE_GAME_CONTROLLERS: (checked during SDL_Init)
Use SDL2's higher-level Game Controller API to expose joysticks instead of
its lower-level joystick API. The benefit of this is that you can exert
more control over arbitrary hardware (deadzones, button mapping, device
name, etc), and button and axes layouts are consistent (what is physically
located where an Xbox360's ""A"" button is will always be SDL 1.2 joystick
button 0, ""B"" will be 1, etc). The downside is it might not expose all of
a given piece of hardware's functionality, or simply not make sense in
general...if you need to use a flight stick, for example, you should not
use this hint. If there is no known game controller mapping for a joystick,
and this hint is in use, it will not be listed as an availble device.,SDL12COMPAT_WINDOW_SCALING: (checked during SDL_SetVideoMode)
When creating non-fullscreen, non-resizable windows, use this variable to
size the window differently. If, for example, you have a 4K monitor and the
game is running in a window the size of a postage stamp, you might set this
to 2 to double the size of the window. Fractional values work, so ""1.5""
might be a more-pleasing value on your hardware. You can even shrink the
window with values less than 1.0! When scaling a window like this,
sdl12-compat will use all the usual scaling options
(SDL12COMPAT_OPENGL_SCALING, SDL12COMPAT_SCALE_METHOD, etc). If sdl12-compat
can't scale the contents of the window for various technical reasons, it
will create the window at the originally-requested size. If this variable
isn't specified, it defaults to 1.0 (no scaling).,SDL12COMPAT_MAX_VIDMODE: (checked during SDL_Init)
This is a string in the form of ,, where , is the maximum width
and , is the maximum height (for example: ,). The list of valid
resolutions that will be reported by SDL_ListModes and SDL_VideoModeOK will
not include any dimensions that are wider or taller than these sizes. A size
of zero will be ignored, so for , a resolution of 1920x480 would be
accepted). If not specified, or set to ,, no resolution clamping is done.
This is for old software-rendered games that might always choose the largest
resolution offered, but never conceived of 4K displays. In these cases, it
might be better for them to use a smaller resolution and let sdl12-compat
scale their output up with the GPU.,SDL_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SCALING: (checked during SDL_SetVideoMode)
If enabled, relative mouse motion is scaled when the application is
running at a non-native resolution.  This may be required with some
applications which use their own mouse cursors. See also:
,SDL12COMPAT_ALLOW_THREADED_DRAWS: (checked during SDL_Init)
Enabled by default.
If disabled, calls to , from non-main threads are
converted into requests for the main thread to carry out the update later.
The thread that called , is treated as the main thread.,SDL12COMPAT_ALLOW_THREADED_PUMPS: (checked during SDL_Init)
Enabled by default.
If disabled, calls to , from non-main threads are
completely ignored.
The thread that called , is treated as the main thread.,SDL12COMPAT_ALLOW_SYSWM: (checked during SDL_Init)
Enabled by default.
If disabled, SDL_SYSWMEVENT events will not be delivered to the app, and
SDL_GetWMInfo() will fail; this is useful if you have a program that
tries to access X11 directly through SDL's interfaces, but can survive
without it, becoming compatible with, for example, Wayland, or perhaps
just avoiding a bug in target-specific code. Note that sdl12-compat already
disallows SysWM things unless SDL2 is using its ""windows"" or ""x11"" video
backends, because SDL 1.2 didn't have wide support for its SysWM APIs
outside of Windows and X11 anyhow.,The OpenGL scaling feature of sdl12-compat allows applications which wish to
run at a non-native screen resolution to do so without changing the system
resolution. It does this by redirecting OpenGL rendering calls to a ""fake""
backbuffer which is scaled when rendering.,This works well for simple applications, but for more complicated applications
which use Frame Buffer Objects, sdl12-compat needs to intercept and redirect
some OpenGL calls. Applications which access these functions without going
though SDL (even if via a library) may not successfully render anything, or
may render incorrectly if OpenGL scaling is enabled.,In these cases, you can disable OpenGL scaling by setting the environment
variable:,Some applications combine the use of SDL with direct access to the underlying
OS or window system. When running these applications on the same OS and SDL
video driver (e.g. a program written for X11 on Linux is run on X11 on Linux),
sdl12-compat is usually compatible.,However, if you wish to run an application on a different video driver, the
application will be unable to access the underlying API it is expecting, and
may fail. This often occurs trying to run applications written for X11 under
Wayland, and particularly affects a number of popular OpenGL extension loaders.,In this case, the best workaround is to run under a compatibility layer like
XWayland, and set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER environment variable to the driver the
program is expecting:,

        in just a few milliseconds.,plocate works by creating an inverted index over ,
        (combinations of three bytes) in the search strings, which allows it
        to rapidly narrow down the set of candidates to a very small list,
        instead of linearly scanning through every entry. It does nearly all
        I/O asynchronously using ,
        if available (Linux 5.1+), which reduces the impact of seek latency
        on systems without SSDs. Like mlocate and slocate, the returned file
        set is user-dependent, ie. a user will only see a file if find(1)
        would list it (all directories from the root have +rx permissions)."

GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.
The archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.
,
GNU cpio supports the following archive formats: binary, old ASCII,
new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar, and POSIX.1 tar.
The tar format is provided for compatibility with the tar program.
By default, cpio creates binary format archives, for compatibility with
older cpio programs.  When extracting from archives, cpio automatically
recognizes which kind of archive it is reading and can read archives
created on machines with a different byte-order.

,Last modified on February 5th 2008.,I hadn't noticed when I started to code libnatpmp, but another library
was already existing using the same name : Allen Porter made his C++
library in october/november 2007. If you want to have a look at it, it is
available 
,.
So what's next ? maybe I should change the name of my library ?
what do you think of libnatpmpc ? (c like client or like the C language ?)

messages based on your code?!,  You know what's awesome?  It's when the option parser ,
generated based on the beautiful help message that you write yourself!
This way you don't need to write this stupid repeatable parser-code,
and instead can write only the help message--,., helps you create most beautiful command-line interfaces
,:,Beat that! The option parser is generated based on the docstring above
that is passed to , function.  , parses the usage
pattern (,) and option descriptions (lines starting
with dash "","") and ensures that the program invocation matches the
usage pattern; it parses options, arguments and commands based on
that. The basic idea is that ,.,Also, , recommends
putting help message in the module docstrings.,Use , or easy_install:,Alternatively, you can just drop , file into your
project--it is self-contained., is tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.,You can run unit tests using the command:, takes 1 required and 4 optional arguments:, is an optional argument vector; by default , uses
the argument vector passed to your program (,).
Alternatively you can supply a list of strings like ,.,, by default ,, specifies whether the parser should
automatically print the help message (supplied as ,) and
terminate, in case , or , option is encountered
(options should exist in usage pattern, more on that below). If you
want to handle , or , options manually (as other
options), set ,.,, by default ,, is an optional argument that
specifies the version of your program. If supplied, then, (assuming
, option is mentioned in usage pattern) when parser
encounters the , option, it will print the supplied
version and terminate.  , could be any printable object,
but most likely a string, e.g. ,.,Note, when , is set to automatically handle ,,
, and , options, you still need to mention
them in usage pattern for this to work. Also, for your users to
know about them.,, by default ,.  If set to , will
disallow mixing options and positional argument.  I.e. after first
positional argument, all arguments will be interpreted as positional
even if the look like options.  This can be used for strict
compatibility with POSIX, or if you want to dispatch your arguments
to other programs.,The , value is a simple dictionary with options, arguments
and commands as keys, spelled exactly like in your help message.  Long
versions of options are given priority. For example, if you invoke the
top example as:,the return dictionary will be:,Help message consists of 2 parts:,Usage pattern, e.g.:,Option descriptions, e.g.:,Their format is described below; other text is ignored., is a substring of , that starts with
, (case ,) and ends with a , empty line.
Minimum example:,The first word after , is interpreted as your program's name.
You can specify your program's name several times to signify several
exclusive patterns:,Each pattern can consist of the following elements:,Use the following constructs to specify patterns:,If your pattern allows to match argument-less option (a flag) several
times:,then number of occurrences of the option will be counted. I.e.
, will be , if program was invoked as ,. Same works for commands.,If your usage patterns allows to match same-named option with argument
or positional argument several times, the matched arguments will be
collected into a list:,I.e. invoked with , the returned dict will contain , and ,., consist of a list of options that you put
below your usage patterns.,It is necessary to list option descriptions in order to specify:,The rules are as follows:,Every line in , that starts with , or , (not counting
spaces) is treated as an option description, e.g.:,To specify that option has an argument, put a word describing that
argument after space (or equals "","" sign) as shown below. Follow
either <angular-brackets> or UPPER-CASE convention for options'
arguments.  You can use comma if you want to separate options. In
the example below, both lines are valid, however you are recommended
to stick to a single style.:,Use two spaces to separate options with their informal description:,If you want to set a default value for an option with an argument,
put it into the option-description, in form ,:,If the option is not repeatable, the value inside ,
will be interpreted as string.  If it , repeatable, it will be
splited into a list on whitespace:,We have an extensive list of , which cover
every aspect of functionality of ,.  Try them out, read the
source if in doubt.,If you want to split your usage-pattern into several, implement
multi-level help (with separate help-screen for each subcommand),
want to interface with existing scripts that don't use ,, or
you're building the next ""git"", you will need the new ,
parameter (described in API section above). To get you started quickly
we implemented a subset of git command-line interface as an example:
, does one thing and does it well: it implements your
command-line interface.  However it does not validate the input data.
On the other hand there are libraries like , which make validating data a
breeze.  Take a look at ,
which uses , to validate data and report an error to the
user.,Often configuration files are used to provide default values which
could be overriden by command-line arguments.  Since ,
returns a simple dictionary it is very easy to integrate with
config-files written in JSON, YAML or INI formats.

atool,"atool - Introduction,News,Download,Other Links,Copyright and License,Requirements,Building,Installation,Usage and Configuration,Homepage,Feedback,atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar, tar+gzip, zip etc).,The main command is , which extracts files from an archive. Did you ever extract files from an archive, not checking whether the files were located in a subdirectory or in the top directory of the archive, resulting in files scattered all over the place? , overcomes this problem by first extracting to a new directory. If there was only a single file in the archive, that file is moved to the original directory. , also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.,The other commands provided are , (to create archives), , (to list files in archives), and , (to extract files to standard out). As atool invokes external programs to handle the archives, not all commands may be supported for a certain type of archives.,atool identifies archives by their file extension. Sometimes this is not possible - for instance rar archives usually have varying numeric file extensions. In those cases when atool can't identify the format, , is used instead. (atool can be configured not to use ,.),atool is written in Perl by , and is free software (,).,The complete history of atool can be seen ,.,The latest version of atool is 0.39.0, which was released on 2012-04-02:,Precompiled binaries are available as well (sorry, only for the old

libstemmer,"Snowball,
, is a small string processing language for creating
stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval, plus a collection of
stemming algorithms implemented using it.
,
It was originally designed
and built by ,. Martin retired from development in 2014 and Snowball is now
maintained as a community project. Martin originally chose the name Snowball as
a tribute to ,, the
excellent string handling language from the 1960s.  It now also serves as a
metaphor for how the project grows by gathering contributions over time.
,
The Snowball compiler translates a Snowball program into source code in another
language - currently Ada, ISO C, C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Object Pascal,
Python and Rust are supported.
,

,
Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common ""stem"" - for
example, the English stemmer maps ,, ,,
,, ,, and , to ,.
So a searching for , would also find documents which only
have the other forms.
,
This stem form is often a word itself, but this is not always the case as
this is not a requirement for text search systems, which are the intended
field of use.  We also aim to conflate words with the same meaning, rather
than all words with a common linguistic root (so , and ,
don't have the same stem), and over-stemming is more problematic than
under-stemming so we tend not to stem in cases that are hard to resolve.  If
you want to always reduce words to a root form and/or get a root form which is
itself a word then Snowball's stemming algorithms likely aren't the right
answer.

Please address all Snowball-related mail to the ,.

,Android is based on Linux kernel, but sadly and unexplicably,
    Android userspace is not Unix-friendly: in many cases,
    things are done differently than in ""usual"" Unix systems.
    For example, there is no /bin directory (and therefore ubiquitous #!/bin/sh
    scripts won't work). Instead, there is /system/bin.,I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S (SM-T700 model) and I made it compile Busybox as follows:
    ,Some parts won't compile (not all kernel headers are present, libc API
    different or incomplete, etc). The maximal config which did compile
    is now in the git tree, in configs/android_502_defconfig.
    The toolchain provided by Termux is based on Android's Bionic libc
    and Bionic has some design problems. An annoying one is that off_t is
    32-bit, struct_stat::st_size is not off_t (this violates standard
    expectations), therefore CONFIG_LFS=y does not build, and CONFIG_LFS=n
    builds with warnings (printf'ing st->st_size with wrong specifier).

    Build system has a fix for the lost link-time optimizations. In 1.24.0 announcement,
    you might have noticed that sizes unexpectedly grew relative to 1.23.2. Now it is fixed:,Check out a new applet, ""uevent"". It is a netlink listener. It provides
    alternative to having mdev as kernel hotplug helper. Instead of setting up
    the former via ""echo /sbin/mdev >/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug"", start ""uevent mdev""
    early during boot. ""uevent"" will run ""mdev"" for each hotplug event, waiting
    for each child to terminate before starting a next one.,The former method does not require a long-lived listener process,
    but it is racy: many copies of mdev can run in parallel.,.
    (,,
    ,,
    ,),Sizes of busybox-1.23.2 and busybox-1.24.0 (with equivalent config, static uclibc build):,I would like to feature some less-known useful tools in Busybox.
    Let me talk about ""nmeter"" applet. I find myself using it
    surprisingly often. For example, it helped me to correctly parallelize
    a very large multiple kernel build job (~30000 kernel builds)
    so that all CPUs are loaded, but machine isn't evicting file cache
    because it has too many jobs for installed RAM.,

    ,When dealing with a machine which seems to be sluggish, it takes some time
    to pinpoint the cause. It can be lack of free memory. It can be excessive
    CPU load. It can be misbehaving (slow) storage or network.
    nmeter allows to monitor many such parameters and presents them in a
    compact one-line form. This lets you see the time evolution as well.
    Here is an example:,If CPU load is high, the CPU bar will immediately show this.
    %x column shows context switches per second, allowing to detect cases
    where processes are waking and waiting on each other excessively.
    %[mf] is free memory, and it is smart enough to show actual usable memory:
    unlike many other tools, it considers buffer cache as free memory.
    %p and %[pn] columns show forks and number of processes, they let you
    detect a case where a daemon is respawning continuously.
    Two %b numbers are block IO read and write rates. %[neth0] is network IO
    rate on the specified interface. More specifiers exist - please read
    ""nmeter --help"" output.
    ,With -d MSEC option and small values of MSEC, this tool allows to see a
    detailed view of bursty activity. Sometimes you can literally see every
    network packet arriving. To make this possible, this tool is written
    so that it reads the minimum of informaion it needs from /proc.
    In this example, we can see how a packet arrived to eth0, complete with
    its IRQ#30 firing:

    ,As you see, each update takes about 0.2 millisecond of processing
    time. You can run even -d1, if you want. -d0 also works, it is a mode
    where updates are continuous.

    ,On the other hand, with large update interval,
    you can run this tool continuously on a server machine and save its output,
    to be able to investigate mysterious drops in performance at a time when
    there was no operator present. If you have an oopsing server, it is useful
    to have another nmeter instance's output to be constantly printed to
    its console, if you want to see what was going on just before oops.
    ""Is my server occasionally dies in an IRQ storm?"" situation.

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace programs
to export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. The FUSE project consists
of two components: the , kernel module (maintained in the regular
kernel repositories) and the , userspace library (maintained
in this repository). libfuse provides the reference implementation
for communicating with the FUSE kernel module.,A FUSE file system is typically implemented as a standalone
application that links with libfuse. libfuse provides functions to
mount the file system, unmount it, read requests from the kernel, and
send responses back. libfuse offers two APIs: a ""high-level"",
synchronous API, and a ""low-level"" asynchronous API. In both cases,
incoming requests from the kernel are passed to the main program using
callbacks. When using the high-level API, the callbacks may work with
file names and paths instead of inodes, and processing of a request
finishes when the callback function returns. When using the low-level
API, the callbacks must work with inodes and responses must be sent
explicitly using a separate set of API functions.,libfuse is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in
production use across a wide range of systems for many years. However,
at present libfuse does not have any active, regular contributors. The
current maintainer continues to apply pull requests and makes regular
releases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development
beyond addressing high-impact issues. When reporting bugs, please
understand that unless you are including a pull request or are
reporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response. If
you are using libfuse, please consider contributing to the project.,You can download libfuse from
,. To build and install, you
must use , and
,.  After extracting the libfuse
tarball, create a (temporary) build directory and run Meson:,Normally, the default build options will work fine. If you
nevertheless want to adjust them, you can do so with the
, command:,To build, test, and install libfuse, you then use Ninja:,Running the tests requires the ,
Python module. Instead of running the tests as root, the majority of
tests can also be run as a regular user if , is made
setuid root first:,The , program is installed setuid root. This is done to
allow normal users to mount their own filesystem implementations.,To limit the harm that malicious users can do this way, ,
enforces the following limitations:,The user can only mount on a mountpoint for which they have write
permission,The mountpoint must not be a sticky directory which isn't owned by
the user (like /tmp usually is),No other user (including root) can access the contents of the
mounted filesystem (though this can be relaxed by allowing the use
of the , and , mount options in
,),If you intend to use the , mount options, be aware that
FUSE has an unresolved ,: if the
, mount option is not used, the results of the
first permission check performed by the file system for a directory
entry will be re-used for subsequent accesses as long as the inode of
the accessed entry is present in the kernel cache - even if the
permissions have since changed, and even if the subsequent access is
made by a different user. This is of little concern if the filesystem
is accessible only to the mounting user (which has full access to the
filesystem anyway), but becomes a security issue when other users are
allowed to access the filesystem (since they can exploit this to
perform operations on the filesystem that they do not actually have
permissions for).,This bug needs to be fixed in the Linux kernel and has been known
since 2006 but unfortunately no fix has been applied yet. If you
depend on correct permission handling for FUSE file systems, the only
workaround is to use , (which does not currently
support ACLs), or to completely disable caching of directory entry
attributes.,FUSE comes with several example file systems in the ,
directory. For example, the , examples mirror the contents
of the root directory under the mountpoint. Start from there and adapt
the code!,The documentation of the API functions and necessary callbacks is
mostly contained in the files , (for the high-level
API) and , (for the low-level API). An
autogenerated html version of the API is available in the ,
directory and at ,.,If you need help, please ask on the ,
mailing list (subscribe at
,).,Please report any bugs on the GitHub issue tracker at

            Vulkan is constantly evolving to bring new capabilities and improvements to the API. Here are some of the most recent developments
          ,Khronos has released finalized extensions, collectively called ‘Vulkan Video’, for seamlessly integrating hardware-accelerated video compression and decompression into the Vulkan API. This API incorporates industry feedback and exposes core decode Vulkan Video functionality to provide fully accelerated H.264 and H.265 decode.,Vulkan Video adheres to the Vulkan philosophy of providing applications flexible, fine-grained control over scheduling, synchronization, and memory allocation. By leveraging the existing Vulkan API framework, the Vulkan Video extensions enable efficient, low-latency, low-overhead use of processing resources for accelerated video processing.,The Khronos Vulkan Video subgroup welcomes all developer feedback and is carefully monitoring the Vulkan issue tracker on GitHub.,Khronos has introduced a new extension named VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library that allows for shaders to be compiled much earlier than at full Pipeline State Object (PSO) creation time. By leveraging this extension, I was able to avoid many causes of frame hitches due to PSOs being late-created at draw time in the Source 2 Vulkan renderer.,This document outlines a proposal to allow partial compilation of portions of pipelines,The Vulkan API is under constant development, with an ever-growing pool of extensions to solve problems and add valuable new features. With Vulkan 1.3 and the new public roadmap, we’re taking a significant step to reduce feature fragmentation.,The Vulkan API is under constant development, with an ever-growing pool of extensions to solve problems and add valuable new features. However, extensions typically don't come with a deployment timeline or a guarantee of which devices will support them. As a result, it can be hard for developers to have a clear picture of when and where extensions will be supported, and what functionality can be relied on for current and future projects. This situation is even more complex for developers shipping applications across both mobile and desktop platforms.,Vulkan 1.3 mandates widely supported features into the core standard; the Vulkan Roadmap provides visibility into Vulkan’s future requirements for key markets; Profiles streamline development and deployment of portable applications,The newly released VK_KHR_synchronization2 extension brings extensive improvements to Vulkan queue submission, events, and pipeline barriers to significantly improve API usability for developers.,The goal of this article is to help developers easily understand and not be intimidated or confused by one of the toughest aspects of Vulkan: Synchronization. ,See this chapter in the Vulkan Guide for an overview of the latest Vulkan synchronization capabilities,See the details of VK_KHR_synchronization2 in the Vulkan specification,Demonstrates the use of the reworked synchronization api introduced with VK_KHR_synchronization2. This sample uses the new extension to streamline memory barriers used for compute and graphics work submissions.,Khronos® has released the final versions of the set of Vulkan®, GLSL and SPIR-V extension specifications that seamlessly integrate ray tracing into the existing Vulkan framework.,For an overview of Ray Tracing in Vulkan, check out this chapter in the Vulkan Guide,Start with the Ray Traversal and Ray Tracing sections of the Vulkan Spec for more details,Render a basic scene using the official cross-vendor ray tracing extension. Shows how to setup all data structures required for ray tracing,The new timeline semaphore synchronization API defines a primitive containing a superset of both the original VkSemaphore and VkFence primitives while simultaneously eliminating many of the most painful limitations of the previous APIs,See detials for Timeline Semaphore in the Vulkan Specification,Demonstrates various use cases which are enabled with timeline semaphores. The sample implements ""Game of Life"" using out-of-order signal and wait, multiple waits on same semaphore in different queues, waiting and signalling semaphore on host.,The VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate extension provides a new, flexible technique to control the fragment shading rate, enabling developers to perform shading at a lower resolution than the render targets.,See detials for VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate in the Vulkan Specification,Uses a special framebuffer attachment to control fragment shading rates for different framebuffer regions. This allows explicit control over the number of fragment shader invocations for each pixel covered by a fragment,Android is enabling a host of useful new Vulkan extensions for mobile. These new extensions are set to improve the state of graphics APIs for modern applications, enabling new use cases and changing how developers can design graphics renderers going forward.,See details for Descriptor Indexing in the Vulkan Specification,Demonstrates how to use descriptor indexing to enable update-after-bind and non-dynamically uniform indexing of descriptors,If you're just starting out in your Graphics Programming journey, we've listed a few recommended resources to help get you spun up on the basics.,

potentially nested inside an exception group. This function returns a context manager

an exception class or an iterable of exception classes. Each value must be a callable

an exception group as an argument which will contain all the exceptions that are any
of the given types, or their subclasses. The exception group may contain nested groups
containing more matching exceptions.,Thus, the following Python 3.11+ code:,would be written with this backport like this:,: Just like with ,, you cannot handle , or

groups to be printed properly in tracebacks. But in cases when the monkey patching is
blocked by a third party exception hook, or monkey patching is explicitly disabled,
you can still manually format exceptions using the special versions of the ,
functions, like ,, listed at the top of this page. They work just
like their counterparts in the , module, except that they use a separately
patched subclass of , to perform the rendering.,Particularly in cases where a library installs its own exception hook, it is recommended
to use these special versions to do the actual formatting of exceptions/tracebacks.,

,The GNU Find Utilities are the basic directory searching utilities of
the GNU operating system.  These programs are typically used in
conjunction with other programs to provide modular and powerful
directory search and file locating capabilities to other commands.
,
The tools supplied with this package are:
,
The , program searches a directory tree to find a file
or group of files.  It traverses the directory tree and reports all
occurrences of a file matching the user's specifications.  The
, program includes very powerful searching capability.
,
The , program scans one or more databases of filenames
and displays any matches.  This can be used as a very fast find
command if the file was present during the last file name database
update.
,
The , program updates the file name database used by
the , program.  The file name database contains lists of
files that were in particular directory trees when the databases were
last updated.  This is usually run nightly by the cron system daemon.
,
The , program builds and executes command lines by
gathering together arguments it reads on the standard input.  Most
often, these arguments are lists of file names generated by
,.
,
The manual is available in the , of the ,.  Use , to access the top level info
page.  Use , to access the Find Utilities section
directly.
,
An ,
is also available, but please note that this is not always fully
up-to-date.
,
Here is an example operation to make all HTML files in the
subdirectory , readable by all using find and xargs.
This is a typical example of how find and xargs are used with other
utilities to provide powerful directory traversal capability.
,
,
,
See the online info documentation described above for more examples.

Released versions of GNU findutils can be found in the subdirectory
, on your favorite ,.  For other ways to obtain
findutils, please read ,.  The latest released version will be the latest version
available here at ,.
,
In between “stable”
releases there are also alpha releases which incorporate the newest
features or bugfixes, and which are released so that interested
parties can test these.  The releases are announced on the mailing
list, and you should join the mailing list if you plan to test the
alpha releases.

Findutils releases are signed by the GNU findutils maintainers as part of
the procedure for uploading to the FTP site.

,
  Official releases can be downloaded as source archives as described
  above, but the findutils source code is also available via

  , for details.
,If you would like to report a bug, please do so via the ,.  If a bug is reported via the web
page, a notification is automatically sent to the
<bug-findutils@gnu.org> mailing list.  It is not required to
submit a bug report via the Savannah bug form, but doing so will
prevent the bug from being missed or forgotten and is therefore
encouraged.  It will also ensure that you are notified when the bug
has been fixed.
,However, there will be occasions where you're not sure whether the
problem you have is actually a bug, or you just want to talk about
ideas for improving findutils.  Using the mailing list is a good way
to do that.  You can

For general discussion of findutils, the ,
mailing list is the most appropriate forum.  An archive of the
findutils bug report mailing list is available at ,.  If you
have a problem and are not sure it is a bug, or even if you are sure,
feel free to open a discussion of the issue on the mailing list.
Searching the archive prior to opening a new discussion is recommended
as many common problems will have already been discussed and
explained.
,
When reporting problems, please be patient.  It may just be that the
volunteers are busy.  Every message to the bug lists are read by many
people.  Sometimes there is just nothing to say at the time.  If you
think your message might not have made it to the list or that you may
have missed the response then check the mail archives as described
above.  If you do not see your message in the archive then we did not
see it either.  Or perhaps your formatting was such that it was
unreadable.  A number of posts are unreadable because the text was
encoded and it could not be deciphered.  If it does not show up as
plain text in the archive then it did not get sent to the list in
plain text format.
,
To contact the maintainers, either to report a bug or to contribute
fixes or improvements, send mail to ,.
Please send messages as ,.  If posting
patches they should be in unified diff format against the latest cvs
testing version available from Savannah if possible or the last alpha
test release as the next best version.  They should include a text
description and the unified diff inline in the message and not
attached to it.  This makes the messages the most readable to the
widest audience and increases the chances of your patches being
included in the project.

python-snowballstemmer,"Snowball,
, is a small string processing language for creating
stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval, plus a collection of
stemming algorithms implemented using it.
,
It was originally designed
and built by ,. Martin retired from development in 2014 and Snowball is now
maintained as a community project. Martin originally chose the name Snowball as
a tribute to ,, the
excellent string handling language from the 1960s.  It now also serves as a
metaphor for how the project grows by gathering contributions over time.
,
The Snowball compiler translates a Snowball program into source code in another
language - currently Ada, ISO C, C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Object Pascal,
Python and Rust are supported.

,
Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common ""stem"" - for
example, the English stemmer maps ,, ,,
,, ,, and , to ,.
So a searching for , would also find documents which only
have the other forms.
,
This stem form is often a word itself, but this is not always the case as
this is not a requirement for text search systems, which are the intended
field of use.  We also aim to conflate words with the same meaning, rather
than all words with a common linguistic root (so , and ,
don't have the same stem), and over-stemming is more problematic than
under-stemming so we tend not to stem in cases that are hard to resolve.  If
you want to always reduce words to a root form and/or get a root form which is
itself a word then Snowball's stemming algorithms likely aren't the right
answer.

high level language that's easy to experiment with and tweak. To people familiar
with Lex and Yacc, ,'s code will be simple to understand. It also
has no external dependencies (except for a Python interpreter), making it very
simple to install and deploy., aims to support the full C99 language (according to the standard

Python installations that strip docstrings (such as when using the Python

, and , funded Dag Seljebotn to greatly improve
,.
Kurt Smith and Danilo Freitas were funded through the , program to work on improved Fortran and C++ support respectively,
and in 2010 Haoyu Bai was funded to work on ,.
,
to Greg Ewing for inventing and developing Cython's predecessor
,
and for his valuable input in language design decisions.
,
,
,What users have to say about Cython:,»You would expect a whole lot of organizations and people to fancy a
language that's about as high-level as Python, yet almost as fast and
down-to-the-metal as C.,Add to that the ability to seamlessly integrate with both
your existing C/++ codebase and your Python codebase, easily mix very
high level abstractions with very low-level machine access... clear
winner.« →
, on c.l.py
,»You guys rock!
In scikit-learn, we have decided early on to do Cython, rather than C or
C++. That decision has been a clear win because the code is way more
maintainable. We have had to convince new contributors that Cython was
better for them, but the readability of the code, and the capacity to
support multiple Python versions, was worth it.« →
,
,»The biggest surprise (and of course this is Cython's selling
point) is how simple the interfacing between high level and low level
code becomes, and the fact that it is all very robust.,It's exiciting to see that there are several active projects around
that attempt to speed up Python.  The nice thing about Cython is that
it doesn't give you ""half the speed of C"" or ""maybe nearly the speed
of C, 3 years from now"" -- it gives the real deal, -O3 C, and it works
right now.« →
,
,»SciPy is approximately 50% Python, 25% Fortran, 20% C, 3% Cython
and 2% C++ … The distribution of secondary programming languages in SciPy
is a compromise between a powerful, performance-enhancing language that
interacts well with Python (that is, Cython) and the usage of languages
(and their libraries) that have proven reliable and performant over many
decades.,For implementing new functionality, Python is still the language
of choice. If Python performance is an issue, then we prefer the use of
Cython followed by C, C++ or Fortran (in that order). The main motivation
for this is maintainability: Cython has the highest abstraction level, and
most Python developers will understand it. C is also widely known, and
easier for the current core development team to manage than C++ and
especially Fortran.« →
,
,»Not to mention that the generated C often makes use of
performance tricks that are too tedious or arcane to write by hand,
partially motivated by scientific computing’s constant push.  And
through all that, Cython code maintains a high level of integration
with Python itself, right down to the stack trace and line numbers.,PayPal has certainly benefitted from their efforts through
high-performance Cython users like gevent, lxml, and NumPy.  While our
first go with Cython didn’t stick in 2011, since 2015, all native
extensions have been written and rewritten to use Cython.«

»I'm honestly never going back to writing C again. Cython gives
me all the expressiveness of Python combined with all the performance
and close-to-the-metal-godlike-powers of C. I've been using it to
implement high-performance graph traversal and routing algorithms and
to interface with C/C++ libraries, and it's been an absolute amazing
productivity boost.« →
,
,»A general rule of thumb is that your program spends 80% of
its time running 20% of the code.  Thus a good strategy for efficient
coding is to write everything, profile your code, and optimize the
parts that need it.  Python’s profilers are great, and Cython allows
you to do the latter step with minimal effort.« →
,
,»The question was, in auto-generated code, to what extent there
were bugs there, to what extent there were bugs in the generators.  The
first time I did this, I got lots and lots of warnings from the tool for
code generated by both SWIG and Cython [...],Basically, everything I found Cython emitting was a false positive and
a bug in my checker tool [CPyChecker].« →

»Using Cython allows you to just put effort into speeding up the
parts of code you need to work on, and to do so without having to
change very much.  This is vastly different from ditching all the code
and reimplementing it another language.  It also requires you to learn
a pretty minimal amount of stuff.  You also get to keep the niceness of
the Python syntax which may Python coders have come to
appreciate.« →

offer better performance than Cython if you know the quirks and are

,Ultimately, there's 5 commonly used ways (CPython [C-API],
Boost::Python, SWIG, Cython, ctypes) to integrate C into Python, and
right now you'd be crazy not to give Cython a shot, if that's your
need. It's very easy to learn for anyone familiar with both C and

calculation times I encountered while doing a multi-variable
optimization with a function evaluation that involved solving a
differential equation with scipy.integrate.odeint.  By simply
replacing the class that contained the differential equation with a
Cython version the calculation time dropped by a factor 5.  Not bad
for half a Sunday afternoons work.« →

,»This is why the Scipy folks keep harping about Cython – it’s
rapidly becoming (or has already become) the lingua franca of exposing
legacy libraries to Python.  Their user base has tons of legacy code
or external libraries that they need to interface, and most of the
reason Python has had such a great adoption curve in that space is
because Numpy has made the data portion of that interface easy.

The Cython version took about 30 minutes to write, and it runs just as fast as the C code — because, why wouldn’t it? It *is* C code, really, with just some syntactic sugar. And you don’t even have to learn or think about a foreign, complicated C API…You just, write C. Or C++ — although that’s a little more awkward. Both the Cython version and the C version are about 70x faster than the pure Python version, which uses Numpy arrays.

Cython saves you from a great many of the gotchas [that C has].
The worst you'll usually get is a lack of performance gain (at which point cython -a is your friend).
Wringing out all the performance you can get can require a reasonable working knowledge of C -- but you don't have to know it that well to do pretty darn well.

[uvloop] is written in Cython, and by the way, Cython is just amazing.
It's unfortunate that it's not as wide-spread and I think it's kind-a
underappreciated what you can do in Cython.  Essentially, it's a
superset of the Python language, you can strictly type it and it will
compile to C and you will have C speed.  You can easily achieve it,
with a syntax more similar to Python.  Definitely check out Cython.

,MD4C stands for ""Markdown for C"" and that's exactly what this project is about.,In short, Markdown is the markup language this , file is written in.,The following resources can explain more if you are unfamiliar with it:,MD4C is Markdown parser implementation in C, with the following features:, Generally, MD4C aims to be compliant to the latest version of
,. Currently, we are
fully compliant to CommonMark 0.30., MD4C supports some commonly requested and accepted extensions.
See below., MD4C is ,., MD4C parser is implemented in one source file and one header
file. There are no dependencies other than standard C library., MD4C parser is easy to reuse in other projects, its API is
very straightforward: There is actually just one function, ,., MD4C parses the complete document and calls few callback
functions provided by the application to inform it about a start/end of
every block, a start/end of every span, and with any textual contents., MD4C builds and works on Windows and POSIX-compliant OSes.
(It should be simple to make it run also on most other platforms, at least as
long as the platform provides C standard library, including a heap memory
management.), MD4C by default expects UTF-8 encoding of the input document.
But it can be compiled to recognize ASCII-only control characters (i.e. to
disable all Unicode-specific code), or (on Windows) to expect UTF-16 (i.e.
what is on Windows commonly called just ""Unicode""). See more details below., MD4C is available under the ,.,If you need just to parse a Markdown document, you need to include ,
and link against MD4C library (,); or alternatively add ,
directly to your code base as the parser is only implemented in the single C
source file.,The main provided function is ,. It takes a text in the Markdown
syntax and a pointer to a structure which provides pointers to several callback
functions.,As , processes the input, it calls the callbacks (when entering or
leaving any Markdown block or span; and when outputting any textual content of
the document), allowing application to convert it into another format or render
it onto the screen.,If you need to convert Markdown to HTML, include , and link against
MD4C-HTML library (,); or alternatively add the sources ,,
, and , into your code base.,To convert a Markdown input, call , function. It takes the Markdown
input and calls the provided callback function. The callback is fed with
chunks of the HTML output. Typical callback implementation just appends the
chunks into a buffer or writes them to a file.,The default behavior is to recognize only Markdown syntax defined by the
,.,However, with appropriate flags, the behavior can be tuned to enable some
extensions:,With the flag ,, a non-trivial whitespace is
collapsed into a single space.,With the flag ,, GitHub-style tables are supported.,With the flag ,, GitHub-style task lists are supported.,With the flag ,, strike-through spans are enabled
(text enclosed in tilde marks, e.g. ,).,With the flag , permissive URL autolinks
(not enclosed in , and ,) are supported.,With the flag ,, permissive e-mail
autolinks (not enclosed in , and ,) are supported.,With the flag , permissive WWW autolinks
without any scheme specified (e.g. ,) are supported. MD4C
then assumes , scheme.,With the flag , LaTeX math spans (,) and
LaTeX display math spans (,) are supported. (Note though that the
HTML renderer outputs them verbatim in a custom tag ,.),With the flag ,, wiki-style links (, and
,) are supported. (Note that the HTML renderer
outputs them in a custom tag ,.),With the flag ,, underscore (,) denotes an underline
instead of an ordinary emphasis or strong emphasis.,Few features of CommonMark (those some people see as mis-features) may be
disabled with the following flags:,With the flag , or ,, raw inline
HTML or raw HTML blocks respectively are disabled.,With the flag ,, indented code blocks are
disabled.,The CommonMark specification declares that any sequence of Unicode code points
is a valid CommonMark document.,But, under a closer inspection, Unicode plays any role in few very specific
situations when parsing Markdown documents:,For detection of word boundaries when processing emphasis and strong
emphasis, some classification of Unicode characters (whether it is
a whitespace or a punctuation) is needed.,For (case-insensitive) matching of a link reference label with the
corresponding link reference definition, Unicode case folding is used.,For translating HTML entities (e.g. ,) and numeric character
references (e.g. , or ,) into their Unicode equivalents.,However note MD4C leaves this translation on the renderer/application; as
the renderer is supposed to really know output encoding and whether it
really needs to perform this kind of translation. (For example, when the
renderer outputs HTML, it may leave the entities untranslated and defer the
work to a web browser.),MD4C relies on this property of the CommonMark and the implementation is, to
a large degree, encoding-agnostic. Most of MD4C code only assumes that the
encoding of your choice is compatible with ASCII. I.e. that the codepoints
below 128 have the same numeric values as ASCII.,Any input MD4C does not understand is simply seen as part of the document text
and sent to the renderer's callback functions unchanged.,The two situations (word boundary detection and link reference matching) where
MD4C has to understand Unicode are handled as specified by the following
preprocessor macros (as specified at the time MD4C is being built):,If preprocessor macro , is defined, MD4C assumes UTF-8 for the
word boundary detection and for the case-insensitive matching of link labels.,When none of these macros is explicitly used, this is the default behavior.,On Windows, if preprocessor macro , is defined, MD4C uses
, instead of , and assumes UTF-16 encoding in those situations.
(UTF-16 is what Windows developers usually call just ""Unicode"" and what
Win32API generally works with.),Note that because this macro affects also the types in ,, you have
to define the macro both when building MD4C as well as when including
,.,Also note this is only supported in the parser (,). The HTML
renderer does not support this and you will have to write your own custom
renderer to use this feature.,If preprocessor macro , is defined, MD4C assumes nothing but
an ASCII input.,That effectively means that non-ASCII whitespace or punctuation characters
won't be recognized as such and that link reference matching will work in
a case-insensitive way only for ASCII letters (,).,The API of the parser is quite well documented in the comments in the ,.
Similarly, the markdown-to-html API is described in its header ,.,There is also , which provides
some more comprehensive documentation. However note it is incomplete and some
details may be somewhat outdated., Some other implementations combine Markdown parser and HTML generator
into a single entangled code hidden behind an interface which just allows the
conversion from Markdown to HTML. They are often unusable if you want to
process the input in any other way.,Even when the parsing is available as a standalone feature, most parsers (if
not all of them; at least within the scope of C/C++ language) are full DOM-like
parsers: They construct abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the whole
Markdown document. That takes time and it leads to bigger memory footprint.,It's completely fine as long as you really need it. If you don't need the full
AST, there is a very high chance that using MD4C will be substantially faster
and less hungry in terms of memory consumption.,Last but not least, some Markdown parsers are implemented in a naive way. When
fed with a ,, they
may exhibit quadratic (or even worse) parsing times. What MD4C can still parse
in a fraction of second may turn into long minutes or possibly hours with them.
Hence, when such a naive parser is used to process an input from an untrusted
source, the possibility of denial-of-service attacks becomes a real danger.,A lot of our effort went into providing linear parsing times no matter what
kind of crazy input MD4C parser is fed with. (If you encounter an input pattern
which leads to a sub-linear parsing times, please do not hesitate and report it
as a bug.), No. And we are proud of it. :-),CommonMark specification states that any sequence of Unicode characters is
a valid Markdown document. (In practice, this more or less always means UTF-8
encoding.),In other words, according to the specification, it does not matter whether some
Markdown syntax construction is in some way broken or not. If it is broken, it
will simply not be recognized and the parser should see it just as a verbatim
text.,MD4C takes this a step further: It sees any sequence of bytes as a valid input,
following completely the GIGO philosophy (garbage in, garbage out). I.e. any
ill-formed UTF-8 byte sequence will propagate to the respective callback as
a part of the text.,If you need to validate that the input is, say, a well-formed UTF-8 document,
you have to do it on your own. The easiest way how to do this is to simply
validate the whole document before passing it to the MD4C parser.,MD4C is covered with MIT license, see the file ,.,Ports and bindings to other languages:,:

enchant,"Enchant,by Dom Lachowicz,Current maintainer: Reuben Thomas,Enchant is a library (and command-line program) that wraps a number of
different spelling libraries and programs with a consistent interface. By
using Enchant, you can use a wide range of spelling libraries, including
some specialised for particular languages, without needing to program to
each library's interface. If it's not convenient to call a C library, you
can access most of Enchant's functionality via the enchant program, which
communicates over a pipe, like ispell, and is indeed ispell-compatible.,Enchant is capable of having multiple backends loaded at once. Currently, Enchant has the following backends:,You can get Enchant from ,.,Older versions are still available from the ,.,Enchant is used by , (as of version 27.1), ,,
,, and,
via ,
and ,, a number of Gtk
and GNOME applications.,Backends for additional spell-checking systems are welcomed.,Enchant is written in plain C99 and C++11, and should therefore work on
most modern operating systems; other than the standard libraries, it
requires only ,. The
build system uses GNU Autotools, and therefore works with most compilers,
including Microsoft Visual C and XCode.,Bindings are available to many other languages:,All inputs and outputs are in UTF-8 encoding. Language tags use
the familiar ISO standards, and take the form of ""xx_YY""
(language_LOCALE), where the locale (""_YY"") portion is optional, but
encouraged.,Please use , if possible to file bugs, offer patches or request new features.
  Even better, submit a ,!
  Alternatively, feel free to send a message to the abiword-devel mailing list.
,Enchant is quite mature, but it still lacks features. Some work has
already been done as part of past Google Summer of Code projects that has
not yet been integrated into releases (see the issue tracker). Some
functionality available in the underlying spelling libraries but not yet
supported by Enchant could also usefully be added to Enchant's APIs.,If you'd like to contribute to Enchant, please read the file ,.

,Enchant is licensed under the LGPL license, with an
  , so that non-free plugin backends
can be loaded and used by Enchant. Thus, it is possible to use
the native spell checkers on proprietary platforms (macOS, MS Office, …).,The definition of ""Enchant"" is roughly ""to cast a spell"". So, it's a pun!"

is a free software / Open Source C library that provides
a set of parsers and serializers that
generate Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples
by parsing syntaxes or serialize the triples into a syntax.
The supported parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML, N-Quads, N-Triples 1.0
and 1.1, TRiG, Turtle 2008 and 2013, RDFa 1.0 and 1.1, RSS tag soup
including all versions of RSS, Atom 0.3 and Atom 1.0, GRDDL and
microformats for HTML, XHTML and XML.  The serializing syntaxes are
RDF/XML (regular, abbreviated, XMP), Turtle 2013, N-Quads, N-Triples
1.1, Atom 1.0, RSS 1.0, GraphViz DOT, HTML, JSON and mKR.
,Raptor was designed to work closely with the

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,Tenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in
Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything.
It originates from , which is sadly no longer
,. Tenacity isn't
api compatible with retrying but adds significant new functionality and
fixes a number of longstanding bugs.,The simplest use case is retrying a flaky function whenever an Exception
occurs until a value is returned.,To install ,, simply:,As you saw above, the default behavior is to retry forever without waiting when
an exception is raised.,Let's be a little less persistent and set some boundaries, such as the number
of attempts before giving up.,We don't have all day, so let's set a boundary for how long we should be
retrying stuff.,You can combine several stop conditions by using the | operator:,Most things don't like to be polled as fast as possible, so let's just wait 2
seconds between retries.,Some things perform best with a bit of randomness injected.,Then again, it's hard to beat exponential backoff when retrying distributed
services and other remote endpoints.,Then again, it's also hard to beat combining fixed waits and jitter (to
help avoid thundering herds) when retrying distributed services and other
remote endpoints.,When multiple processes are in contention for a shared resource, exponentially
increasing jitter helps minimise collisions.,Sometimes it's necessary to build a chain of backoffs.,We have a few options for dealing with retries that raise specific or general
exceptions, as in the cases here.,We can also use the result of the function to alter the behavior of retrying.,See also these methods:,We can also combine several conditions:,Any combination of stop, wait, etc. is also supported to give you the freedom
to mix and match.,It's also possible to retry explicitly at any time by raising the TryAgain
exception:,Normally when your function fails its final time (and will not be retried again based on your settings),
a RetryError is raised. The exception your code encountered will be shown somewhere in the ,
of the stack trace.,If you would rather see the exception your code encountered at the , of the stack trace (where it
is most visible), you can set reraise=True.,It's possible to execute an action before any attempt of calling the function
by using the before callback function:,In the same spirit, It's possible to execute after a call that failed:,It's also possible to only log failures that are going to be retried. Normally
retries happen after a wait interval, so the keyword argument is called
,:,You can access the statistics about the retry made over a function by using the
retry attribute attached to the function and its statistics attribute:,You can also define your own callbacks. The callback should accept one
parameter called , that contains all information about current
retry invocation.,For example, you can call a custom callback function after all retries failed,
without raising an exception (or you can re-raise or do anything really), argument is an object of RetryCallState class:,It's also possible to define custom callbacks for other keyword arguments.,Here's an example with a custom , function:,You can change the arguments of a retry decorator as needed when calling it by
using the retry_with function attached to the wrapped function:,If you want to use variables to set up the retry parameters, you don't have
to use the retry decorator - you can instead use Retrying directly:,Tenacity allows you to retry a code block without the need to wraps it in an
isolated function. This makes it easy to isolate failing block while sharing
context. The trick is to combine a for loop and a context manager.,You can configure every details of retry policy by configuring the Retrying
object.,With async code you can use AsyncRetrying.,In both cases, you may want to set the result to the attempt so it's available

  ,Stuart Bishop <,>,pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows
accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4
or higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end
of daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python
Library Reference (,).,Almost all of the Olson timezones are supported.,Note,Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support
now included as part of the standard library, and third party
packages work with it such as ,.
pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with
code written for earlier versions of Python.,Note,This library differs from the documented Python API for
tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock
times you need to use the , method documented in this
document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local
times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect
timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get
2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A
, method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these
issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime
implementation (see PEP-431).,This package can either be installed using , or from a tarball using the
standard Python distutils.,If you are installing using ,, you don’t need to download anything as the
latest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI:,If you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an
administrative user:,Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.,The maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. ,.,This library only supports two ways of building a localized time. The
first is to use the , method provided by the pytz library.
This is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone
information):,The second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing
localized time using the standard , method:,Unfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime
constructors ‘’does not work’’ with pytz for many timezones.,It is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such
as UTC:,The preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,
converting to localtime only when generating output to be read
by humans.,This library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local
times, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you
need to use the , method to handle daylight saving time
and other timezone transitions. In this example, , is set
to the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern
timezone.,Creating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with
local times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass
a , argument when constructing a datetime (see the next
section for more details),Converting between timezones is more easily done, using the
standard astimezone method.,You can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone
conversions. , and , are not really
necessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to
deal with.,The , instances returned by the , function have
been extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ,
parameter to the ,, , && , methods.,The , parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used
during DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.,If , is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raise
an , exception.,The major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes
may occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern timezone
on the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence
happens:,01:00 EDT occurs,1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour
and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST),In fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means
that if you try and create a time in the ‘US/Eastern’ timezone
the standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant
before of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the
pytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:,As you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%
chance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does
not matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people
in different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.,The best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz
package encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by
including a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python
reference implementation in the Python documentation.,The UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a
smaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation
can be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone(‘UTC’).,Note that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,
Greenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these
other timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will
not compare the same in Python.,See the section ,, below.,If you insist on working with local times, this library provides a
facility for constructing them unambiguously:,If you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to
guess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent
times.,For example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern
timezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving
Time:,Similarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the
US/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping
the entire hour:,Both of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling
easier:,A special case is where countries change their timezone definitions
with no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw
switched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings
transition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks
were wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot
be specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the
actual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time
during a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by
treating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings
time, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.,The best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is
by converting from another timezone such as UTC:,The standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to
handle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern
timezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this
implementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is
included for tests only!):,Notice the first two results? At first glance you might think they are
correct, but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are
actually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.,A mechanism is provided to access the timezones commonly in use
for a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country code.
It returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevant
tzinfo instance using ,:,The Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English country
name mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:,‘UTC’ is ,. It is a successor to, but distinct
from, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various definitions of Universal
Time. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating clocks and time
measurement.,All other timezones are defined relative to UTC, and include offsets like
UTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive the local time. No
daylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone to perform
date arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities caused
by daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone, or
mobile computers that roam through multiple timezones.,There are two lists of timezones provided., is the exhaustive list of the timezone names that can
be used., is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn’t
contain deprecated zones or historical zones, except for a few I’ve
deemed in common usage, such as US/Eastern (open a bug report if you
think other timezones are deserving of being included here). It is also
a sequence of strings.,Both , and , are alphabetically
sorted:, and , are also available as sets.,You can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countries
using the , function. It requires an ISO-3166
two letter country code.,Pytz is an interface to the IANA database, which uses ASCII names. The ,
project provides translations. Python packages such as
,
and Thomas Khyn’s , package can be used
to access these translations from Python.,MIT license.,This code is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope Public
License,  Version 2.1 (ZPL).,I’m happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in other
open source projects.,This package will be updated after releases of the Olson timezone
database.  The latest version can be downloaded from the ,.  The code that is used
to generate this distribution is hosted on Github and available
using git:,Announcements of new releases are made on
,, and the
,
hosted there.,Bugs should be reported on ,.
Feature requests are unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directed
to timezone support now built into Python or packages that work with it.,Reports about security issues can be made via ,.,This project is in maintenance mode. Projects using Python 3.9 or later
are best served by using the timezone functionaly now included in core
Python and packages that work with it such as ,.,Offsets from UTC are rounded to the nearest whole minute, so timezones
such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will be up to 30 seconds out. This
was a limitation of the Python datetime library.,If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can’t fix
it. pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and
changes to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.
If you find errors they should be reported to the time zone mailing
list, linked from ,.,More info than you want to know about timezones:

            Vulkan is constantly evolving to bring new capabilities and improvements to the API. Here are some of the most recent developments
          ,Khronos has released finalized extensions, collectively called ‘Vulkan Video’, for seamlessly integrating hardware-accelerated video compression and decompression into the Vulkan API. This API incorporates industry feedback and exposes core decode Vulkan Video functionality to provide fully accelerated H.264 and H.265 decode.,Vulkan Video adheres to the Vulkan philosophy of providing applications flexible, fine-grained control over scheduling, synchronization, and memory allocation. By leveraging the existing Vulkan API framework, the Vulkan Video extensions enable efficient, low-latency, low-overhead use of processing resources for accelerated video processing.,The Khronos Vulkan Video subgroup welcomes all developer feedback and is carefully monitoring the Vulkan issue tracker on GitHub.,Khronos has introduced a new extension named VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library that allows for shaders to be compiled much earlier than at full Pipeline State Object (PSO) creation time. By leveraging this extension, I was able to avoid many causes of frame hitches due to PSOs being late-created at draw time in the Source 2 Vulkan renderer.,This document outlines a proposal to allow partial compilation of portions of pipelines,The Vulkan API is under constant development, with an ever-growing pool of extensions to solve problems and add valuable new features. With Vulkan 1.3 and the new public roadmap, we’re taking a significant step to reduce feature fragmentation.,The Vulkan API is under constant development, with an ever-growing pool of extensions to solve problems and add valuable new features. However, extensions typically don't come with a deployment timeline or a guarantee of which devices will support them. As a result, it can be hard for developers to have a clear picture of when and where extensions will be supported, and what functionality can be relied on for current and future projects. This situation is even more complex for developers shipping applications across both mobile and desktop platforms.,Vulkan 1.3 mandates widely supported features into the core standard; the Vulkan Roadmap provides visibility into Vulkan’s future requirements for key markets; Profiles streamline development and deployment of portable applications,The newly released VK_KHR_synchronization2 extension brings extensive improvements to Vulkan queue submission, events, and pipeline barriers to significantly improve API usability for developers.,The goal of this article is to help developers easily understand and not be intimidated or confused by one of the toughest aspects of Vulkan: Synchronization. ,See this chapter in the Vulkan Guide for an overview of the latest Vulkan synchronization capabilities,See the details of VK_KHR_synchronization2 in the Vulkan specification,Demonstrates the use of the reworked synchronization api introduced with VK_KHR_synchronization2. This sample uses the new extension to streamline memory barriers used for compute and graphics work submissions.,Khronos® has released the final versions of the set of Vulkan®, GLSL and SPIR-V extension specifications that seamlessly integrate ray tracing into the existing Vulkan framework.,For an overview of Ray Tracing in Vulkan, check out this chapter in the Vulkan Guide,Start with the Ray Traversal and Ray Tracing sections of the Vulkan Spec for more details,Render a basic scene using the official cross-vendor ray tracing extension. Shows how to setup all data structures required for ray tracing,The new timeline semaphore synchronization API defines a primitive containing a superset of both the original VkSemaphore and VkFence primitives while simultaneously eliminating many of the most painful limitations of the previous APIs,See detials for Timeline Semaphore in the Vulkan Specification,Demonstrates various use cases which are enabled with timeline semaphores. The sample implements ""Game of Life"" using out-of-order signal and wait, multiple waits on same semaphore in different queues, waiting and signalling semaphore on host.,The VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate extension provides a new, flexible technique to control the fragment shading rate, enabling developers to perform shading at a lower resolution than the render targets.,See detials for VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate in the Vulkan Specification,Uses a special framebuffer attachment to control fragment shading rates for different framebuffer regions. This allows explicit control over the number of fragment shader invocations for each pixel covered by a fragment,Android is enabling a host of useful new Vulkan extensions for mobile. These new extensions are set to improve the state of graphics APIs for modern applications, enabling new use cases and changing how developers can design graphics renderers going forward.,See details for Descriptor Indexing in the Vulkan Specification,Demonstrates how to use descriptor indexing to enable update-after-bind and non-dynamically uniform indexing of descriptors,If you're just starting out in your Graphics Programming journey, we've listed a few recommended resources to help get you spun up on the basics.,

  ,You'll find thriving Vulkan community discussions on several forums and social media platforms below.  It's a great way to get involved!,Vulkan® Portability™ aims to counter platform fragmentation by encouraging layered implementations of Vulkan functionality over Metal, DX12 and other APIs. Vulkan Portability enables Vulkan applications to be reliably deployed across diverse platforms,
            ,
          ,The release of the Vulkan SC 1.0 specification on March 1, 2022 marked an important milestone in delivering a new generation of safety-critical APIs. Based on the Vulkan 1.2 API, Vulkan SC meets the needs of safety-critical systems to leverage the performance of modern GPUs to satisfy their graphics and compute requirements.,

The GMP computers are maintained by a single person on a volunteer basis.  The
ongoing Intel CPU bug debacle with
,,
,,
,,
,,
the jCC/cache-line bug, Fallout, LVI, Portsmash, etc, etc, and the
,
backdoor is making the main GMP server far from as secure as we'd like it to be.
,
The system which runs this web server as well as mail server, mailing list
server, firewall, etc, has an Intel E5-1650 v2 which is affected by most of the
bugs/backdoors mentioned above.  Please keep that in mind when using the
resources here.
,
Please understand that we don't take security lightly, but that we effectively
are
, by
sloppy/malicious engineering.
,
Thanks to a very generous donation from Christian Calderon, the GMP project now
has a brand new, AMD Epyc server which will replace the old server.  This is
great for GMP, not only because of the old server's hardware security issues,
but also since the new server is 3x more powerful than the old one.
,
The new server will be replacing the old server as soon as we have had time to
install all subsystems, which we expect will happen by mid April.
,
  Here are the specs of the system Christian has given us:
,GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.  There is no
practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available
memory in the machine GMP runs on.  GMP has a rich set of functions, and the
functions have a regular interface. ,The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications and
research, Internet security applications, algebra systems, computational
algebra research, etc. ,GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands
and for huge operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic
arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, with highly optimised assembly code
for the most common inner loops for a lot of CPUs, and by a general emphasis on
speed. ,The first GMP release was made in 1991.  It is continually developed and
maintained, with a new release about once a year. ,Since version 6, GMP is distributed under the dual licenses, 
,
and ,.
These licenses make the library free to use, share, and improve, and allow you
to pass on the result.  The GNU licenses give freedoms, but also set firm
restrictions on the use with non-free programs. ,GMP is part of the GNU project.  For more information about the GNU project,
please see the , ,GMP's main target platforms are Unix-type systems, such as GNU/Linux,
Solaris, HP-UX, Mac OS X/Darwin, BSD, AIX, etc.  It also is known to work on
Windows in both 32-bit and 64-bit mode. ,GMP is brought to you by a team ,. ,GMP is carefully developed and maintained, both technically and legally.  We
of course inspect and test contributed code carefully, but equally importantly
we make sure we have the legal right to distribute the contributions, meaning
users can safely use GMP.  To achieve this, we will ask contributors to sign
paperwork where they allow us to distribute their work. ,There are several categories of functions in GMP: ,To try to verify that the file you have downloaded has not been tampered
with, you can check that the GnuPG signature matches the contents of the file.
Use your
, or a

used for creating the signature. Starting from the repackaging of gmp-5.1.0 as
gmp-5.1.0a.tar.* the following key is used to sign GMP releases:
,
Instead of using a release, you may also get the latest code from the
,.  This will require some
more work compared to using a release.
,Please first see the
, on how to report bugs.  The
proper address for bug reports is gmp-bugs at gmplib.org.
,Most problems with GMP these days are due to problems not in GMP, but with
the compiler used for compiling the GMP sources.  This is a major concern to
the GMP project, since an incorrect computation is an incorrect computation,
whether caused by a GMP bug or a compiler bug.  We fight this by making the GMP
testsuite have great coverage, so that it should catch every possible
miscompilation.
,Note that we perform spam and virus filtering of these lists.  The lists
have been 100% spam-free during the last years.
,We're blocking all mail from PR China, since 99% of
the spam arriving to the GMP moderators emanates from PR China.  If you are
affected but have a legitimate reason to send mail to the GMP project, e.g., if
you work at a university or corporation with an interest in GMP, please let us
know; we will open access for you.

The current stable release is 6.2.1, released 2020-11-14. ,

contain only numbers, and aligns them by a decimal point (or flushes
them to the right if they appear to be integers). Text columns are
flushed to the left.,You can override the default alignment with , and ,
named arguments. Possible column alignments are: ,, ,,
,, , (only for numbers), and , (to disable alignment).,Aligning by a decimal point works best when you need to compare numbers

,:,Wide character support is enabled automatically if , library is

uninstalling ,, set the global module-level flag
,:,Most table formats support multiline cell text (text containing newline
characters). The newline characters are honored as line break
characters.,Multiline cells are supported for data rows and for header rows.,Further automatic line breaks are not inserted. Of course, some output
formats such as latex or html handle automatic formatting of the cell
content on their own, but for those that don't, the newline characters
in the input cell text are the only means to break a line in cell text.,Note that some output formats (e.g. simple, or plain) do not represent
row delimiters, so that the representation of multiline cells in such
formats may be ambiguous to the reader.,The following examples of formatted output use the following table with
a multiline cell, and headers with a multiline cell:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:, tables:,Multiline cells are not well-supported for the other table formats.,While tabulate supports data passed in with multilines entries explicitly provided,
it also provides some support to help manage this work internally.,The , argument is a list where each entry specifies the max width for
it's respective column. Any cell that will exceed this will automatically wrap the content.
To assign the same max width for all columns, a singular int scaler can be used.,Use , for any columns where an explicit maximum does not need to be provided,
and thus no automate multiline wrapping will take place.,The wrapping uses the python standard ,
function with default parameters - aside from width.,This example demonstrates usage of automatic multiline wrapping, though typically
the lines being wrapped would probably be significantly longer than this.,One might want to add one or more separating lines to highlight different sections in a table.,The separating lines will be of the same type as the one defined by the specified formatter as either the
linebetweenrows, linebelowheader, linebelow, lineabove or just a simple empty line when none is defined for the formatter,ANSI escape codes are non-printable byte sequences usually used for terminal operations like setting
color output or modifying cursor positions. Because multi-byte ANSI sequences are inherently non-printable,
they can still introduce unwanted extra length to strings. For example:,To deal with this, string lengths are calculated after first removing all ANSI escape sequences. This ensures
that the actual printable length is used for column widths, rather than the byte length. In the final, printable
table, however, ANSI escape sequences are not removed so the original styling is preserved.,Some terminals support a special grouping of ANSI escape sequences that are intended to display hyperlinks
much in the same way they are shown in browsers. These are handled just as mentioned before: non-printable
ANSI escape sequences are removed prior to string length calculation. The only diifference with escaped
hyperlinks is that column width will be based on the length of the URL , rather than the URL
itself (terminals would show this text). For example:,Such features as decimal point alignment and trying to parse everything
as a number imply that ,:,It may not be suitable for serializing really big tables (but who's
going to do that, anyway?) or printing tables in performance sensitive
applications. , is about two orders of magnitude slower than
simply joining lists of values with a tab, comma, or other separator.,At the same time, , is comparable to other table
pretty-printers. Given a 10x10 table (a list of lists) of mixed text and

zita-resampler,"Linux Audio projects at Kokkini Zita,This site in always under construction. We do apologize for
the dust.,Jconvolver is a command line JACK application using the zita-convolver
  library. Complex convolution matrices can be defined in a configuration
  file. The same configuration file can also be used by fconvolver which
  performs the same operation on files rather than real-time.,Jmatconvol is a command line JACK application similar to jconvolver,
but optimised for dense convolution matrices with relatively short
impulse responses, e.g. for processing microphone array signals.
Fmatconvol provides the same for processing files rather than
real-time signals.,Main features:
,Libzita-convolver is a real-time C++ convolution library using FFT based
convolution with non-uniform partition sizes: small ones at the start
of the impulse response and building up to the most efficient size
further on. It can perform zero-delay processing of very long IRs (e.g.
reverbs) with moderate CPU load. The calculations are distributed over
up to five threads, one for each partition size, running at priorities
equal to or just below that of the calling thread. This ensures that
even when multiple instances are active at the same time, CPU resources
will be allocated in the optimum way.,Main features:
,
Libzita-resampler is a C++ library for resampling audio signals. It is designed
to be used within a real-time processing context, to be fast, and to provide
high-quality sample rate conversion.
,
The library operates on signals represented in single-precision floating point
format. For multichannel operation both the input and output signals are
assumed to be stored as interleaved samples.
,
The API allows a trade-off between quality and CPU load. For the latter
a range of approximately 1:6 is available. Even at the highest quality
setting libzita-resampler will be faster than most similar libraries, e.g.
libsamplerate.
,
The source distribution includes the , application.
Input format is any file readable by libsndfile, output is either
WAV (WAVEX for more than 2 channels) or CAF. Apart from resampling
you can change the sample format to 16-bit, 24-bit or float, and for
16-bit output, add dithering. Available dithering types are rectangular,
triangular, and Lipschitz' optimised error feedback filter. Some examples
of dithering can be seen ,
,
Libzita-alsa-pcmi is a C++ library for using ALSA audio devices
with minimal latency and using ALSA's memory-mapped mode (as used
by Jack). It hides most of the complexity of configuring and using
ALSA devices in this way., Input and output audio streams are converted to / from 32-bit
floating point format, regardless of the hardware sample format.
By calling the read and write functions from a real-time thread,
it is easy to provide a callback interface, and to write applications
that work with both ALSA and Jack using the same processing code.
See jaaa or japa for examples.,First presented at the

TetraProc configuration based on the impulse response measurements performed
by Core Sound on your microphone. Currently this configuration does not
use the convolution capabilities of TetraProc, but the results are excellent
even without that. The combination of a very well designed microphone with
IR-based calibration provides an affordable Ambisonic recording system of

writing an email to ,,
which is ,.,Visit the , for an overview of the project.,tslib runs on various hardware architectures and operating systems, including GNU/Linux,

and their package management.,This is just an example , file. Touch samples flow from top to
bottom. Each line specifies one module and its parameters. Modules are
processed in order. Use , , on top, that accesses your device,
followed by any combination of filter modules.,See the , for available filters and their
parameters. On Linux, your first commented-in line should always be
, which offers one optional parameter: ,
if you want it to execute , on the device.,With this configuration file, we end up with the following data flow
through the library:,Calibration is done by the , plugin, which uses its own config file
,. Don't edit this file manually. It is created by the
, program:,The calibration procedure simply requires you to touch a cross on the screen,
where it appears, as accurately as possible.,You may quickly test the touch behaviour that results from the configured
filters, using ,:,On the bottom left of the screen, you will see the available concurrent touch contacts
supported, and whether it's because the driver says so, or , was started
with the , commandline option to overwrite it.,You may override the defaults. In most cases, though, you won't need to do so:,If you're using X.org graphical X server, things should be very easy. Install
tslib and ,,
reboot, and you should instantly have your , filters running, without
configuring anything else yourself., Run , during startup and use
, as your evdev input device.,tslib tries to automatically find your touchscreen device in ,
on Linux. Now make , use it, instead of your graphical environment
directly:, makes the program return and run as a daemon in the background. , makes
it print the , , device node before returning.,Now make your graphical environment use that new input device, using ,
drivers.,For , for example you'd probably set something like this:,QT_QPA_EVDEV_TOUCHSCREEN_PARAMETERS=/dev/input/eventX:rotate=0,For , you'd probably edit your , , for your
touchscreen to have,Option ""Device"" ""/dev/input/eventX"",Please consult your input system's documentation on how to use a specific
evdev input device.,Let's recap the data flow here:,/dev/input/event numbers are not persistent. In order to know in advance,
, enumerated input device file is created by ,, you can use
a symlink:,use the included , script that starts
, and creates the symlink called , for
you, or,if you're using ,, create the following udev rule, for
example ,:,where , the touchscreen found in your ,. The first rule is only needed, if tslib doesn't automatically choose
the correct device for you.,In case you have to use non-default paths, create a file containing the
environment for tslib, like ,and create a systemd service file, such as ,Adjust the paths. They could just as well be in ,, too.,There is no tool that we know of that reads tslib samples and uses the
,,
for example (yet).,Linear scaling - calibration - module, primerily used for conversion of touch
screen co-ordinates to screen co-ordinates. It applies the corrections as
recorded and saved by the , tool. It's the only module that reads
a configuration file.,Parameters (usually not needed):,overwrite the rotation to apply. Clockwise: ,, upside down:
,, counter-clockwise: ,. Default: screen-rotation during
, calibration.,Interchange the X and Y co-ordinates -- no longer used or needed
if the linear calibration utility , is used.,Set the offset applied to the pressure value. Default: 0,factor to multiply the pressure value by. Default: 1.,value to divide the pressure value by. Default: 1.,Example: ,Invert values in the X and/or Y direction around the given value.
There are no default values. If specified, a value has to be
set. If one axis is not specified, it's simply untouched.,Parameters:,X-axis (horizontal) value around which to invert.,Y-axis (vertical) value around which to invert.,Example: , (Y-axis inverted for 640 screen height, X-axis untouched),The median filter reduces noise in the samples' coordinate values. It is
able to filter undesired single large jumps in the signal. For some
theory, see ,Parameters:,Number of samples to apply the median filter to. Default: 3.,Example: ,Pressure threshold filter. Given that a release is always pressure 0 and a
press is always >= 1, this discards samples below / above the specified
pressure threshold.,Parameters:,Minimum pressure value for a sample to be valid. Default: 1.,Maximum pressure value for a sample to be valid. Default: (,).,Example: ,Infinite impulse response filter. This is a smoothing filter to remove
low-level noise. There is a trade-off between noise removal
(smoothing) and responsiveness. The parameters N and D specify the level of
smoothing in the form of a fraction (N/D)., has some
theory.,Parameters:,numerator of the smoothing fraction. Default: 0.,denominator of the smoothing fraction. Default: 1.,Example: ,Removes jitter on the X and Y co-ordinates. This is achieved by applying a
weighted smoothing filter. The latest samples have most weight; earlier
samples have less weight. This allows one to achieve 1:1 input->output rate. See
, for some
theory.,Parameters:,Squared distance between two samples ((X2-X1)^2 + (Y2-Y1)^2) that
defines the 'quick motion' threshold. If the pen moves quick, it
is not feasible to smooth pen motion, besides quick motion is not
precise anyway; so if quick motion is detected the module just
discards the backlog and simply copies input to output. Default: 100.,Example: ,Simple debounce mechanism that drops input events for the specified time
after a touch gesture stopped. ,
has more theory.,Parameters:,drop events up to this number of milliseconds after the last
release event. Default: 0.,Example: ,Skip , samples after press and , samples before release. This
should help if the first or last samples are unreliable for the device.,Parameters:,Number of events to drop after pressure. Default: 1.,Number of events to drop before release. Default: 1.,Example: ,Simple lowpass exponential averaging filtering module.,Parameters:,floating point value between 0 and 1; for example 0.2 for more smoothing
or 0.8 for less. Default: 0.4.,x or y minimum distance between two samples to start applying the
filter. Default: 2.,Example: ,After ""pen/finger down"", N number of input samples need to be delivered by the
driver before they are considered valid and passed on to the user
(application). If ""pen/finger up"" occurs before N samples are being
read from the device driver, tslib will drop the ""tap"".,This filter can be used to avoid touches that, for example, result from
electromagnetic interference. These are known to be shorter than one a real
user would create.,In contrast to the , filter, the , filter will not cut out
events that are part of a real touch input. It will only cut out one
whole ""tap"", if short enough.,Compared to the , filter, this filter will act on every occurrence
of ""pen/finger down"", including the first one, not only starting with the
second. Also, , is time-based, not events-based.,Parameters:,number of events between ""down"" and ""up"" that must be provided
by the device driver for the touch to be considered real and passed on.,Example: ,Variance filter. Tries to do its best in order to filter out random noise
coming from touchscreen ADC's. This is achieved by limiting the sample
movement speed to some value (e.g. the pen is not supposed to move quicker
than some threshold).,There is , support for this filter (yet). , will
limit your input to one slot when this filter is used. Try using the median
filter instead.,Parameters:,Set the squared distance in touchscreen units between previous and
current pen position (e.g. (X2-X1)^2 + (Y2-Y1)^2). This defines the
criteria for determining whenever two samples are 'near' or 'far'
to each other.,Now if the distance between previous and current sample is 'far',
the sample is marked as 'potential noise'. This doesn't mean yet
that it will be discarded; if the next reading will be close to it,
this will be considered just a regular 'quick motion' event, and it
will sneak to the next layer. Also, if the sample after the
'potential noise' is 'far' from both previously discussed samples,
this is also considered a 'quick motion' event and the sample sneaks
into the output stream.,The following example setup,would be achieved by the following ts.conf:,while you are free to play with the parameter values.,The graphical tools support rotating the screen, see
, or the man pages for the details.
, will (in the background) ignore screen rotation
but will save the current rotation state in the ""calibration file""
,. The , filter module will pick that up
and apply the given rotation. It can be overwritten by using
the , module parameter: , (if your
toolkit or higher level application does rotation).,The API is documented in our man pages in the doc directory.

,To use the library from C or C++, include the following preprocessor directive
in your source files:,To link with the library, specify , as an argument to the linker.,On UNIX systems, you can use , to automatically select the appropriate
compiler and linker switches for libts. The , m4 macro may be
used to automatically set the appropriate Makefile variables:,If you want to support tslib < 1.2, while still supporting multitouch and all
recent versions of tslib, you'd do something like this:,This is a complete example program, similar to ,:,If you know how many slots your device can handle, you could avoid malloc:,and call , like so, has
background information.,Usually, and every time until now, libts does not break the ABI and your
application can continue using libts after upgrading. Specifically this is
indicated by the libts library version's major number, which should always stay
the same. According to our versioning scheme, the major number is incremented
only if we break backwards compatibility. The second or third minor version will
increase with releases. In the following example,use , for using tslib unconditionally and , to make sure
your current application never breaks.,If a release includes changes such as added features, the second number is
incremented and the third is set to zero. If a release includes mostly just
bugfixes, only the third number is incremented.,A tslib tarball version number doesn't tell you anything about its backwards
compatibility.,This lists the programs for the , of tslib, facing the outside world.
For testing purposes there are tools like ,
too.,

,
,tslib modules (filter or driver/raw module) in the plugins directory need to
implement ,. If the module takes parameters, it has to declare a
, and pass that, its lengths and the params string
that is passed to , to , during ,.,Furthermore a , has to be declared, with its members
pointing to the module's implementation of module-operations like ,
that get called in the chain of filters.,libts can be built to fit your needs. Use the configure script to enable only
the modules you need. By default, libts is built as a shared library, with
each module being a shared library object itself. You can, however, configure
tslib to build libts statically linked, and the needed modules compiled inside
of libts. Here's an example for this:,This should result in a , of roughly 50 kilobytes, ready for using
calibration (linear filter) and the infinite impulse response filter in ts.conf.,Alternatively, you can use CMake to build the project.
To create building in the project tree:,By default, the core tslib is built as a shared library.
In order to build it as static, add , to the configure line.,Also, the plugins are by default built as shared.  Add , to the configuration step to
build plugins statically into the core tslib. To disable and enable modules,
use flags: ,.,The following is a minimal example of how to use tslib, built with CMake, in your client app.
Adding , as a link target will add required dependencies and include directories generated build files.,In case you cannot draw directly on the framebuffer, there is an ,
implementation of the necessary graphical tools using SDL2. They are more portable,
but require more resources to run. To use them, make sure you have SDL2 and the
development headers installed and use ,.,tslib is cross-platform; you should be able to build it on a large variety of
operating systems.,This is the hardware independent core part: , as
,, build on the following operating systems and probably more.,This makes the thing usable in the real world because it accesses your device.
See , for the currently
possible configuration for your platform.,The libts default configuration currently has the following input modules
,:,Please note that this list may grow over time. If you rely on
a particular input plugin, you should enable it explicitly. On Linux,
you should only need , though.,Writing your own plugin is quite easy, in case an existing one doesn't fit.,For GNU/Linux all architectures are , well covered, thanks to Debian, Arch
Linux, and others.,Please help porting missing programs!, On Linux, use ,For mostly historical reasons, tslib includes device specific , userspace
drivers.
The ,

libffi is Free Software.  It has a very ,.

,

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function. For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call
a given function. Libffi can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

,

The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at
run-time.

,

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language. The
libffi library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface. A layer must
exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.

The developers of the GNU Compiler Collection project have made
innumerable valuable contributions.  See this ChangeLog files in the

,
Some of the ideas behind libffi were inspired by Gianni Mariani's free
gencall library for Silicon Graphics machines.

,
The closure mechanism was designed and implemented by Kresten Krab
Thorup.

,
Major processor architecture ports were contributed by the following
developers:

,
Jesper Skov and Andrew Haley both did more than their fair share of
stepping through the code and tracking down bugs.

Thanks also to Tom Tromey for bug fixes, documentation and
configuration help.

interface.

    News
  ,
    A new major release, ,,
    is now available for download. This release has many new encoders and decoders, filters,
    ffmpeg CLI tool improvements, and also, changes the way releases are done. All major
    releases will now bump the version of the ABI. We plan to have a new major release each
    year. Another release-specific change is that deprecated APIs will be removed after 3
    releases, upon the next major bump.
    This means that releases will be done more often and will be more organized.
  ,
    New decoders featured are Bonk, RKA, Radiance, SC-4, APAC, VQC, WavArc and a few ADPCM formats.
    QSV and NVenc now support AV1 encoding. The FFmpeg CLI (we usually reffer to it as ffmpeg.c
    to avoid confusion) has speed-up improvements due to threading, as well as statistics options,
    and the ability to pass option values for filters from a file. There are quite a few new audio
    and video filters, such as adrc, showcwt, backgroundkey and ssim360, with a few hardware ones too.
    Finally, the release features many behind-the-scenes changes, including a new FFT and MDCT
    implementation used in codecs (expect a blog post about this soon), numerous bugfixes, better
    ICC profile handling and colorspace signalling improvement, introduction of a number of RISC-V
    vector and scalar assembly optimized routines, and a few new improved APIs, which can be viewed
    in the doc/APIchanges file in our tree.
    A few submitted features, such as the Vulkan improvements and more FFT optimizations will be in the
    next minor release, 6.1, which we plan to release soon, in line with our new release schedule.
    Some highlights are:

    This has been a long time coming but we wanted to give a proper closure to our participation in this run of the program and it takes time. Sometimes it's just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.
  ,
    Without further ado, here's the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:
  ,
    Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav's work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.
  ,
    Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.
  ,
    Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair's work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.
  ,
    Ján Sebechlebský's generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so Ján spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.

    Jai Luthra's objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai's code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder's speed and efficiency.

    Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There's still work to be done to call these filters 'finished', which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.

    And that's it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!

    Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of
    January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device
    has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output
    devices have been updated to support SDL2.

    ,, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It fixes several bugs.
  ,
    We recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  ,
    After thorough deliberation, we're announcing that we're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release.
    ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat
    library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has
    been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.
    Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs
    and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.
  ,
    ,, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It mainly deals with a few ABI issues introduced in the previous release.

    upgrade unless they use current git master.

    We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and
    libaacplus in FFmpeg master.
  ,
    Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as
    ,, it was known that libvo-aacenc
    was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.
    However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open
    Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option
    in our code base.
  ,
    When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding
    High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported
    by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.
  ,
    The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by
    Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC
    encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer
    FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth
    supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the
    most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.
  ,
    Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and
    libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition
    to the native encoder (,) when updating to the next version
    of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder
    name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC
    (,) with an appropriate , option
    to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you
    will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing
    headaches.
  ,
    Enjoy!
  ,
    We have made several new point releases (,).
    They fix various bugs, as well as CVE-2016-1897 and CVE-2016-1898.
    Please see the changelog for each release for more details.
  ,
    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use
    current git master.
  ,
    After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag
    removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent
    at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme
    cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater
    quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.
  ,
    Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the
    encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with
    support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly
    free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those
    who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.
  ,
    The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started
    during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.
    Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer
    and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks
    to , who does comparisons
    and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the
    encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide
    feedback or breakage reports through our ,.

    effort. We're looking forward to participating in the next GSoC
    edition!
  ,
    Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of
    each single project.
  ,
    Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to
    implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the
    already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.
  ,
    The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting
    a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and
    partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now
    possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:
  ,
    The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept
    several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not
    have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part
    was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
    Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
    the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded
    content.
  ,
    The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to
    make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement
    real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By
    the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code
    review.
  ,
    Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented
    Samba directory listing as qualification task.
  ,
    During the program he extended the API with the possibility to
    remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the
    implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP
    protocols.
  ,
    At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an
    implementation for HTTP directory listening.
  ,
    Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He
    got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.
  ,
    The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the
    ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.
  ,
    The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the
    ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to
    finally figure out how to get DVB working.
  ,
    Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text
    subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and
    is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported
    by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.
  ,
    ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all
    formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.
  ,
    Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for
    text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like
    bold/italics, highlighting, etc.
  ,
    The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very
    different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary
    encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information
    separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track
    which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing
    with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed
    Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into
    separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.
  ,
    Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size
    information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous
    Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.
  ,
    All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.
  ,
    Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.
    To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework
    and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow
    easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.
    The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were
    tried to avoid speed loss.
  ,
    He also added gamma corrected scaling support.
    An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:
  ,
    Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,
    and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to
    FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has
    ended.
  ,
    Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main
    prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only
    TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has
    been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further
    improvements.
  ,
    PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the
    energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and
    the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a
    simple feature.
  ,
    TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding
    artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something
    that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy
    bands).
  ,
    Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by
    exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective
    on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as
    effective on classic X-Y recordings though.
  ,
    Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting
    correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been
    huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,
    and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for
    further improvements to make.
  ,
    In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,
    something he's also working to fix.
  ,
    Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the
    qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via
    various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend
    modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.
  ,
    Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays
    correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder
    produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.
  ,
    During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the
    decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG
    specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the
    PNG decoder has been fixed.
  ,
    For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,
    making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the
    encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.

    Dear multimedia community,
  ,
    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.
  ,
    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
    which have split the community for so long.
  ,
    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
    weeks, and in person at the , in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
    multimedia community.

    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.

the input and output types are clearly specified. We mostly prefer composition
over inheritance, because inheritance can result in too much functionality in
the same object. We prefer immutable objects where possible (objects don't
change after initialization). Reusability is important. We absolutely refrain
from having a changing global state, it should be possible to have multiple
independent instances of the same code in the same process. The architecture
should be layered: the lower levels operate on primitive operations and data
structures giving -- when correctly combined -- all the possible flexibility;
while at the higher level, there should be a simpler API, ready-to-use and
sufficient for most use cases. Thinking about algorithms and efficiency is
important, but avoid premature optimization.,

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,inflect.py - Correctly generate plurals, singular nouns, ordinals, indefinite articles; convert numbers to words.,The methods of the class , in module , provide plural
inflections, singular noun inflections, ""a""/""an"" selection for English words,
and manipulation of numbers as words.,Plural forms of all nouns, most verbs, and some adjectives are
provided. Where appropriate, ""classical"" variants (for example: ""brother"" ->
""brethren"", ""dogma"" -> ""dogmata"", etc.) are also provided.,Single forms of nouns are also provided. The gender of singular pronouns
can be chosen (for example ""they"" -> ""it"" or ""she"" or ""he"" or ""they"").,Pronunciation-based ""a""/""an"" selection is provided for all English
words, and most initialisms.,It is also possible to inflect numerals (1,2,3) to ordinals (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
and to English words (""one"", ""two"", ""three"").,In generating these inflections, , follows the Oxford
English Dictionary and the guidelines in Fowler's Modern English
Usage, preferring the former where the two disagree.,The module is built around standard British spelling, but is designed
to cope with common American variants as well. Slang, jargon, and
other English dialects are , explicitly catered for.,Where two or more inflected forms exist for a single word (typically a
""classical"" form and a ""modern"" form), , prefers the
more common form (typically the ""modern"" one), unless ""classical""
processing has been specified
(see MODERN VS CLASSICAL INFLECTIONS).,All of the , plural inflection methods take the word to be
inflected as their first argument and return the corresponding inflection.
Note that all such methods expect the , form of the word. The
results of passing a plural form are undefined (and unlikely to be correct).
Similarly, the , singular inflection method expects the ,
form of the word.,The , methods also take an optional second argument,
which indicates the grammatical ""number"" of the word (or of another word
with which the word being inflected must agree). If the ""number"" argument is
supplied and is not , (or , or ,, or some other adjective that
implies the singular), the plural form of the word is returned. If the
""number"" argument , indicate singularity, the (uninflected) word
itself is returned. If the number argument is omitted, the plural form
is returned unconditionally.,The , method takes a second argument in a similar fashion. If it is
some form of the number ,, or is omitted, the singular form is returned.
Otherwise the plural is returned unaltered.,The various methods of , are:,The method , takes a , English noun,
pronoun, verb, or adjective and returns its plural form. Where a word
has more than one inflection depending on its part of speech (for
example, the noun ""thought"" inflects to ""thoughts"", the verb ""thought""
to ""thought""), the (singular) noun sense is preferred to the (singular)
verb sense.,Hence , will return ""knives"" (""knife"" having been treated
as a singular noun), whereas , will return ""knife""
(""knifes"" having been treated as a 3rd person singular verb).,The inherent ambiguity of such cases suggests that,
where the part of speech is known, ,, ,, and
, should be used in preference to ,.,Note that all these methods ignore any whitespace surrounding the
word being inflected, but preserve that whitespace when the result is
returned. For example, , returns "" cats  "".,The , methods return only the inflected word, not the count that
was used to inflect it. Thus, in order to produce ""I saw 3 ducks"", it
is necessary to use:,Since the usual purpose of producing a plural is to make it agree with
a preceding count, inflect.py provides a method
(,) which, given a word and a(n optional) count, returns the
count followed by the correctly inflected word. Hence the previous
example can be rewritten:,In addition, if the count is zero (or some other term which implies
zero, such as ,, ,, etc.) the count is replaced by the
word ""no"". Hence, if , had the value zero, the previous example
would print (the somewhat more elegant):,rather than:,Note that the name of the method is a pun: the method
returns either a number (a ,) or a ,, in front of the
inflected word.,In some contexts, the need to supply an explicit count to the various
, methods makes for tiresome repetition. For example:,inflect.py therefore provides a method
(,) which may be used to set a persistent ""default number""
value. If such a value is set, it is subsequently used whenever an
optional second ""number"" argument is omitted. The default value thus set
can subsequently be removed by calling , with no arguments.
Hence we could rewrite the previous example:,Normally, , returns its first argument, so that it may also
be ""inlined"" in contexts like:,However, in certain contexts (see INTERPOLATING INFLECTIONS IN STRINGS)
it is preferable that , return an empty string. Hence ,
provides an optional second argument. If that argument is supplied (that is, if
it is defined) and evaluates to false, , returns an empty string
instead of its first argument. For example:,inflect.py also provides a solution to the problem
of comparing words of differing plurality through the methods
,, ,,
,, and ,.
Each  of these methods takes two strings, and  compares them
using the corresponding plural-inflection method (,, ,,
,, and , respectively).,The comparison returns true if:,Hence all of the following return true:,As indicated by the comments in the previous example, the actual value
returned by the various , methods encodes which of the
three equality rules succeeded: ""eq"" is returned if the strings were
identical, ""s:p"" if the strings were singular and plural respectively,
""p:s"" for plural and singular, and ""p:p"" for two distinct plurals.
Inequality is indicated by returning an empty string.,It should be noted that two distinct singular words which happen to take
the same plural form are , considered equal, nor are cases where
one (singular) word's plural is the other (plural) word's singular.
Hence all of the following return false:,Note too that, although the comparison is ""number-insensitive"" it is ,
case-insensitive (that is, , returns false. To obtain
both number and case insensitivity, use the , method on both strings
(that is, , returns true).,Shout out to these libraries that provide related functionality:,Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.,This project and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use.,.,To report a security vulnerability, please use the

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,The ""z"" library implements the commonly required image processing basics of
scaling, colorspace conversion, and depth conversion. A simple API enables
conversion between any supported formats to operate with minimal knowledge
from the programmer. All library routines were designed from the ground-up
with correctness, flexibility, and thread-safety as first priorities.
Allocation, buffering, and I/O are cleanly separated from processing, allowing
the programmer to adapt ""z"" to many scenarios.,The officially supported build system is GNU autotools. Use the provided
""autogen.sh"" script to instantiate the familiar ""configure"" and ""make"" build
system. Visual Studio project files are not stable and are subject to change.,Colorspaces: SMPTE-C (NTSC), Rec.709, Rec.2020,The colorspace module provides for conversion between any combination of
colorspaces, as defined by the commonly used triplet of matrix coefficients,
transfer characteristics, and color primaries. Conversions are implemented
with intelligent logic that minimizes the number of intermediate
representations required for common scenarios, such as conversion between
YCbCr and RGB. Support is also provided for the non-traditional YCbCr system
of ITU-R BT.2020 constant luminance (CL), which retains higher fidelity with
chroma subsampling. Note that ""z"" is not a color management system and should
not be used to perform drastic contrast or gamut reduction, such as BT.2020
to BT.709.,Formats: BYTE, WORD, HALF, FLOAT,The depth module provides for conversion between any pixel (number) format,
including one and two-byte integer formats as well as IEEE-754 binary16
(OpenEXR) and binary32 formats. Limited range (16-235) and full swing (0-255)
integer formats are supported, including conversion between such formats.
Multiple dithering methods are available when converting to integer formats,
from basic rounding to high quality error diffusion.,The resize module provides high fidelity linear resamplers, including the
popular Bicubic and Lanczos filters. Resampling ratios of up to 100x are
supported for upsampling and downsampling. Full support is provided for
various coordinate systems, including the various chroma siting conventions
(e.g. JPEG and MPEG2) as well as interlaced images.,""z"" is optimized for Intel(R) Architecture and features faster processing times

GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the Stringprep,
Punycode and IDNA 2003 specifications.  Libidn's purpose is to encode and
decode internationalized domain names.  The native C, C# and Java
libraries are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 2.1 or later.
,
The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation.  Profiles
for Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are included.
Punycode and ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported.
A mechanism to define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation
tables, and to compare strings against those tables, is included.
Default tables for some TLDs are also included.
,
The Stringprep API consists of two main functions, one for converting
data from the system's native representation into UTF-8, and one
function to perform the Stringprep processing.  Adding a new
Stringprep profile for your application within the API is
straightforward.  The Punycode API consists of one encoding function
and one decoding function.  The IDNA API consists of the ToASCII and
ToUnicode functions, as well as an high-level interface for converting
entire domain names to and from the ACE encoded form.  The TLD API
consists of one set of functions to extract the TLD name from a domain
string, one set of functions to locate the proper TLD table to use
based on the TLD name, and core functions to validate a string against
a TLD table, and some utility wrappers to perform all the steps in one
call.
,
The library is used by, e.g., GNU SASL and Shishi to process user
names and passwords.  Libidn can be built into GNU Libc to enable a
new system-wide getaddrinfo flag for IDN processing.
,
Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20 Unix
platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows.  The
library is written in C and (parts of) the API is also accessible from
C++, Emacs Lisp, Python and Java.  A native Java and C# port is
included.
,
Also included is a command line tool, several self tests, code
examples, and more, all licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 3.0 or later.

set a standard for where applications should find/store preferences, cache files, and other
run-time files/data, mostly based on the values of certain environment variables.,I'm not a huge fan of the specifications: the arbitrary requirement that timestamps on files be
updated periodically to avoid cleanup places an unnecessary burden on applications, and the
workaround of setting the sticky bit is an abuse of a defunct feature. However, having a way of
specifying where certain kinds of files should be placed is useful, and applications do make
use of the specification (and this library).,There appears to be doxygen-based comments, but I have not attempted to build documentation.,The library uses autotools so can usually be built and installed via an invocation similar to:,You can install to an alternate root location (for creation of packages etc) using

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,http-parser is ,.
New projects and projects looking to migrate should consider ,.,This is a parser for HTTP messages written in C. It parses both requests and
responses. The parser is designed to be used in performance HTTP
applications. It does not make any syscalls nor allocations, it does not
buffer data, it can be interrupted at anytime. Depending on your
architecture, it only requires about 40 bytes of data per message
stream (in a web server that is per connection).,Features:,The parser extracts the following information from HTTP messages:,One , object is used per TCP connection. Initialize the struct
using , and set the callbacks. That might look something
like this for a request parser:,When data is received on the socket execute the parser and check for errors., needs to know where the end of the stream is. For example, sometimes
servers send responses without Content-Length and expect the client to
consume input (for the body) until EOF. To tell , about EOF, give
, as the fourth parameter to ,. Callbacks and errors
can still be encountered during an EOF, so one must still be prepared
to receive them.,Scalar valued message information such as ,, ,, and the
HTTP version are stored in the parser structure. This data is only
temporally stored in , and gets reset on each new message. If
this information is needed later, copy it out of the structure during the
, callback.,The parser decodes the transfer-encoding for both requests and responses
transparently. That is, a chunked encoding is decoded before being sent to
the on_body callback., supports upgrading the connection to a different protocol. An
increasingly common example of this is the WebSocket protocol which sends
a request like,followed by non-HTTP data.,(See , for more information the
WebSocket protocol.),To support this, the parser will treat this as a normal HTTP message without a
body, issuing both on_headers_complete and on_message_complete callbacks. However
http_parser_execute() will stop parsing at the end of the headers and return.,The user is expected to check if , has been set to 1 after
, returns. Non-HTTP data begins at the buffer supplied
offset by the return value of ,.,During the , call, the callbacks set in
, will be executed. The parser maintains state and
never looks behind, so buffering the data is not necessary. If you need to
save certain data for later usage, you can do that from the callbacks.,There are two types of callbacks:,Callbacks must return 0 on success. Returning a non-zero value indicates
error to the parser, making it exit immediately.,For cases where it is necessary to pass local information to/from a callback,
the , object's , field can be used.
An example of such a case is when using threads to handle a socket connection,
parse a request, and then give a response over that socket. By instantiation
of a thread-local struct containing relevant data (e.g. accepted socket,
allocated memory for callbacks to write into, etc), a parser's callbacks are
able to communicate data between the scope of the thread and the scope of the
callback in a threadsafe manner. This allows , to be used in
multi-threaded contexts.,Example:,In case you parse HTTP message in chunks (i.e. , request line
from socket, parse, read half headers, parse, etc) your data callbacks
may be called more than once. , guarantees that data pointer is only
valid for the lifetime of callback. You can also , into a heap allocated
buffer to avoid copying memory around if this fits your application.,Reading headers may be a tricky task if you read/parse headers partially.
Basically, you need to remember whether last header callback was field or value
and apply the following logic:,A simplistic zero-copy URL parser is provided as ,.
Users of this library may wish to use it to parse URLs constructed from
consecutive , callbacks.,See examples of reading in headers:,

Ogg is a stream oriented container, meaning it can be written

pcre,"PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions,The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
   expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
   Perl 5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of
   wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression
   API. The PCRE library is free, even for building proprietary
   software.,PCRE was originally written for the
   ,,
   but is now used by many high-profile open source projects, including

    now at end of life, and is no longer being actively maintained. Version
    8.45 is expected to be the final release of the older PCRE library,

    code to download via HTTPS, Git, or Subversion from the new home on
    GitHub instead.,If you just need the command-line PCRE or PCRE2 tools on Windows,
   precompiled binary versions are available at this

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,Highway is a C++ library that provides portable SIMD/vector intrinsics.,We are passionate about high-performance software. We see major untapped
potential in CPUs (servers, mobile, desktops). Highway is for engineers who want
to reliably and economically push the boundaries of what is possible in
software.,CPUs provide SIMD/vector instructions that apply the same operation to multiple
data items. This can reduce energy usage e.g. , because fewer
instructions are executed. We also often see , speedups.,Highway makes SIMD/vector programming practical and workable according to these
guiding principles:,: Highway is a C++ library with carefully-chosen
functions that map well to CPU instructions without extensive compiler
transformations. The resulting code is more predictable and robust to code
changes/compiler updates than autovectorization.,: Highway supports four architectures; the
same application code can target eight instruction sets, including those with
'scalable' vectors (size unknown at compile time). Highway only requires C++11
and supports four families of compilers. If you would like to use Highway on
other platforms, please raise an issue.,: Applications using Highway can run on heterogeneous
clouds or client devices, choosing the best available instruction set at
runtime. Alternatively, developers may choose to target a single instruction set
without any runtime overhead. In both cases, the application code is the same
except for swapping , with , plus one
line of code.,: Highway provides an extensive set of
operations, used for image processing (floating-point), compression, video
analysis, linear algebra, cryptography, sorting and random generation. We
recognise that new use-cases may require additional ops and are happy to add
them where it makes sense (e.g. no performance cliffs on some architectures). If
you would like to discuss, please file an issue.,: Highway provides tools such as Gather,
MaskedLoad, and FixedTag to enable speedups for legacy data structures. However,
the biggest gains are unlocked by designing algorithms and data structures for
scalable vectors. Helpful techniques include batching, structure-of-array
layouts, and aligned/padded allocations.,Online demos using Compiler Explorer:,We observe that Highway is referenced in the following open source projects,
found via sourcegraph.com. Most are Github repositories. If you would like to
add your project or link to it directly, feel free to raise an issue or contact
us via the below email.,Other,If you'd like to get Highway, in addition to cloning from this Github repository
or using it as a Git submodule, you can also find it in the following package
managers or repositories: alpinelinux, conan-io, conda-forge, DragonFlyBSD,
freebsd, ghostbsd, microsoft/vcpkg, MidnightBSD, NetBSD, openSUSE, opnsense,
Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries.,Highway supports 17 targets, listed in alphabetical order of platform:,SVE was initially tested using farm_sve (see acknowledgments).,Highway releases aim to follow the semver.org system (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH),
incrementing MINOR after backward-compatible additions and PATCH after
backward-compatible fixes. We recommend using releases (rather than the Git tip)
because they are tested more extensively, see below.,The current version 1.0 signals an increased focus on backwards compatibility.
Applications using documented functionality will remain compatible with future
updates that have the same major version number.,Continuous integration tests build with a recent version of Clang (running on
native x86, or QEMU for RVV and ARM) and MSVC 2019 (v19.28, running on native
x86).,Before releases, we also test on x86 with Clang and GCC, and ARMv7/8 via GCC
cross-compile. See the , for
details.,The , directory contains SIMD-related utilities: an image class with
aligned rows, a math library (16 functions already implemented, mostly
trigonometry), and functions for computing dot products and sorting.,If you only require x86 support, you may also use Agner Fog's
,. It includes many
functions including a complete math library.,If you have existing code using x86/NEON intrinsics, you may be interested in
,, which emulates those
intrinsics using other platforms' intrinsics or autovectorization.,This project uses CMake to generate and build. In a Debian-based system you can
install it via:,Highway's unit tests use ,.
By default, Highway's CMake downloads this dependency at configuration time.
You can disable this by setting the , CMake variable to ON and
installing gtest separately:,Running cross-compiled tests requires support from the OS, which on Debian is
provided by the , package.,To build Highway as a shared or static library (depending on BUILD_SHARED_LIBS),
the standard CMake workflow can be used:,Or you can run , (, on Windows).,Bazel is also supported for building, but it is not as widely used/tested.,When building for Arm v7, a limitation of current compilers requires you to add
, to the CMake command line; see #834 and #1032. We
understand that work is underway to remove this limitation.,You can use the , inside examples/ as a starting point.,A , briefly lists all operations
and their parameters, and the ,
indicates the number of instructions per operation.,The , answers questions about portability, API design and
where to find more information.,We recommend using full SIMD vectors whenever possible for maximum performance
portability. To obtain them, pass a , (or equivalently
,) tag to functions such as ,. There are two
alternatives for use-cases requiring an upper bound on the lanes:,For up to , lanes, specify , or the equivalent
,. The actual number of lanes will be , rounded down to
the nearest power of two, such as 4 if , is 5, or 8 if , is 8. This is
useful for data structures such as a narrow matrix. A loop is still required
because vectors may actually have fewer than , lanes.,For exactly a power of two , lanes, specify ,. The largest
supported , depends on the target, but is guaranteed to be at least
,.,Due to ADL restrictions, user code calling Highway ops must either:,Additionally, each function that calls Highway ops (such as ,) must either
be prefixed with ,, OR reside between , and
,. Lambda functions currently require , before
their opening brace.,The entry points into code using Highway differ slightly depending on whether
they use static or dynamic dispatch.,For static dispatch, , will be the best available target among
,, i.e. those allowed for use by the compiler (see
,). Functions inside
, can be called using , within
the same module they are defined in. You can call the function from other
modules by wrapping it in a regular function and declaring the regular
function in a header.,For dynamic dispatch, a table of function pointers is generated via the
, macro that is used by , to
call the best function pointer for the current CPU's supported targets. A
module is automatically compiled for each target in , (see
,) if , is
defined and , is included.,When using dynamic dispatch, , is included from translation
units (.cc files), not headers. Headers containing vector code shared between
several translation units require a special include guard, for example the
following taken from ,:,By convention, we name such headers , because their contents (often
function templates) are usually inlined.,Applications should be compiled with optimizations enabled - without inlining,
SIMD code may slow down by factors of 10 to 100. For clang and GCC, , is
generally sufficient.,For MSVC, we recommend compiling with , to allow non-inlined functions to
pass vector arguments in registers. If intending to use the AVX2 target together
with half-width vectors (e.g. for ,), it is also important to compile
with ,. This seems to be the only way to generate VEX-encoded SSE4
instructions on MSVC. Otherwise, mixing VEX-encoded AVX2 instructions and
non-VEX SSE4 may cause severe performance degradation. Unfortunately, the
resulting binary will then require AVX2. Note that no such flag is needed for
clang and GCC because they support target-specific attributes, which we use to
ensure proper VEX code generation for AVX2 targets.,To vectorize a loop, ""strip-mining"" transforms it into an outer loop and inner
loop with number of iterations matching the preferred vector width.,In this section, let , denote the element type, ,, ,
the number of elements to process, and , the number of lanes in a
full vector. Assume the loop body is given as a function ,.,Highway offers several ways to express loops where , need not divide ,:,Ensure all inputs/outputs are padded. Then the loop is simply,Here, the template parameter and second function argument are not needed.,This is the preferred option, unless , is in the thousands and vector
operations are pipelined with long latencies. This was the case for
supercomputers in the 90s, but nowadays ALUs are cheap and we see most
implementations split vectors into 1, 2 or 4 parts, so there is little cost
to processing entire vectors even if we do not need all their lanes. Indeed
this avoids the (potentially large) cost of predication or partial
loads/stores on older targets, and does not duplicate code.,Process whole vectors and include previously processed elements
in the last vector:,This is the second preferred option provided that ,
and , is idempotent. Some elements might be processed twice, but
a single code path and full vectorization is usually worth it. Even if
,, it usually makes sense to pad inputs/outputs up to ,.,Use the , functions in hwy/contrib/algo/transform-inl.h. This
takes care of the loop and remainder handling and you simply define a
generic lambda function (C++14) or functor which receives the current vector
from the input/output array, plus optionally vectors from up to two extra
input arrays, and returns the value to write to the input/output array.,Here is an example implementing the BLAS function SAXPY (,):,Process whole vectors as above, followed by a scalar loop:,The template parameter and second function arguments are again not needed.,This avoids duplicating code, and is reasonable if , is large.
If , is small, the second loop may be slower than the next option.,Process whole vectors as above, followed by a single call to a modified
, with masking:,Now the template parameter and third function argument can be used inside
, to non-atomically 'blend' the first , lanes of ,
with the previous contents of memory at subsequent locations:
,. Similarly,
, loads the first
, elements and returns zero in other lanes.,This is a good default when it is infeasible to ensure vectors are padded,
but is only safe ,!
In contrast to the scalar loop, only a single final iteration is needed.
The increased code size from two loop bodies is expected to be worthwhile
because it avoids the cost of masking in all but the final iteration.,We have used , by Berenger
Bramas; it has proved useful for checking the SVE port on an x86 development
machine.,This is not an officially supported Google product.

    ,June 16, 2022,This is the latest stable release of the Speex codec
		and the Speex DSP library.,December 7, 2016,This is the latest stable release of the Speex codec library.,January 3, 2015,This brown-paper-bag release adds two headers that should
                   have been included with SpeexDSP 1.2rc2. These are needed
                   to build the resampler with NEON optimizations and to build
                   SpeexDSP without the Speex codec library.
                ,December 6, 2014,This release splits the speex codec library and the speex DSP library
                   into separate source trees. Both projects received build-system
                   improvements, bugfixes, and cleanup. The speex codec's VBR tuning was
                   improved, while the speexdsp resampler got some NEON optimizations.
                ,July 23, 2008,This release adds support for acoustic echo cancellation with multiple 
                microphones and multiple loudspeakers. It also adds an API to decorrelate
                loudspeaker signals to improve multi-channel performance. In the bugfix
                department, there are fixes for a few bugs in the echo canceller, jitter 
                buffer and preprocessor. At this point, the API for 1.2 should be stable
                and only a few very minor additions are planned.,December 11, 2007,The most obvious change in this release is that all the non-codec components (preprocessor,
                echo cancellation, jitter buffer) have been moved to a new , library. 
                Other changes include a new jitter buffer algorithm and resampler improvements/fixes. This is also
                the first release where libspeex can be built without any floating point support. To do this,
                the float compatibility API must be disabled (--disable-float-api or DISABLE_FLOAT_API) and
                the VBR feature must be disabled (--disable-vbr or DISABLE_VBR).,The Xiph , and the Speex Parrot logos are trademarks (™) of Xiph.Org.,These pages © 1994–2006 Xiph.Org. All rights reserved.,Last Modified: ,Validate , and "

llvm-libs,"The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
   toolchain technologies.  Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with
   traditional virtual machines.  The name
   ""LLVM"" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.,LLVM began as a , at
   the ,, with
   the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable
   of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary
   programming languages.  Since then, LLVM has
   grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of
   subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of
   , projects
   as well as being widely used in ,.  Code

    target-independent ,, along with

    popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built
    around a , code representation
    known as the LLVM intermediate representation (""LLVM IR"").  The LLVM Core
    libraries are ,, and it is particularly
    easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use
    ,., is an ""LLVM native""
    C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles,
    extremely useful , and to provide a platform for building great
    source level tools.
    The , and
    , are
    tools that automatically find bugs in your code, and are great examples of the
    sort of tools that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to
    parse C/C++ code.,The , project builds on
    libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger.
    It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler,
    etc so that it provides an experience that ""just works"".  It is also
    blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols.
    ,The , and
    , projects provide
    a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++
    Standard Library, including full support for C++11 and C++14.,The , project
    provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator
    support routines like "","" and other calls generated when
    a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement
    a core IR operation. It also provides implementations of run-time libraries
    for dynamic testing tools such as
    ,,
    ,,
    ,,
    and
    ,.
    ,The , subproject is a novel
    approach to building reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure. MLIR
    aims to address software fragmentation, improve compilation for heterogeneous
    hardware, significantly reduce the cost of building domain specific compilers,
    and aid in connecting existing compilers together.
    ,The , subproject
    provides an , runtime for use with the
    OpenMP implementation in Clang.,The , project implements
    a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and
    vectorization using a polyhedral model.,The , project aims to
    implement the OpenCL standard library.,The , project implements a
    ""symbolic virtual machine"" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate
    all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove
    properties of functions.  A major feature of klee is that it can produce a
    testcase in the event that it detects a bug.,The , project is a new
    linker. That is a drop-in replacement for system linkers
    and runs much faster.,The ,
    project is a post-link optimizer. It achieves the improvements by optimizing
    application's code layout based on execution profile gathered by sampling
    profiler.,In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of
other projects that ,.  Through these external projects you can use
LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Rust, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, Julia, and a number of
other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and
reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different
tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages
like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.,As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people

Libevent can also be used for multi-threaded
applications, either by isolating each event_base so that only a single
thread accesses it, or by locked access to a single shared event_base.

Libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network
IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, zero-copy file

  , ,The aim of the , module is to provide a transparent object proxy
for Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
wrappers and decorator functions.,The , module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes
way beyond existing mechanisms such as , to ensure that
decorators preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities
etc. The decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in
far more scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and
consistent behaviour.,To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module
is used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a
pure Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not
have a compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.,For further information on the , module see:,To implement your decorator you need to first define a wrapper function.
This will be called each time a decorated function is called. The wrapper
function needs to take four positional arguments:, - The wrapped function which in turns needs to be called by your wrapper function., - The object to which the wrapped function was bound when it was called., - The list of positional arguments supplied when the decorated function was called., - The dictionary of keyword arguments supplied when the decorated function was called.,The wrapper function would do whatever it needs to, but would usually in
turn call the wrapped function that is passed in via the ,
argument.,The decorator , then needs to be applied to the wrapper
function to convert it into a decorator which can in turn be applied to
other functions.,If you wish to implement a decorator which accepts arguments, then wrap the
definition of the decorator in a function closure. Any arguments supplied
to the outer function when the decorator is applied, will be available to
the inner wrapper when the wrapped function is called.,When applied to a normal function or static method, the wrapper function
when called will be passed , as the , argument.,When applied to an instance method, the wrapper function when called will
be passed the instance of the class the method is being called on as the
, argument. This will be the case even when the instance method
was called explicitly via the class and the instance passed as the first
argument. That is, the instance will never be passed as part of ,.,When applied to a class method, the wrapper function when called will be
passed the class type as the , argument.,When applied to a class, the wrapper function when called will be passed
, as the , argument. The , argument in this
case will be the class.,The above rules can be summarised with the following example.,Using these checks it is therefore possible to create a universal decorator
that can be applied in all situations. It is no longer necessary to create
different variants of decorators for normal functions and instance methods,
or use additional wrappers to convert a function decorator into one that
will work for instance methods.,In all cases, the wrapped function passed to the wrapper function is called
in the same way, with , and , being passed. The
, argument doesn’t need to be used in calling the wrapped
function.,Full source code for the , module, including documentation files
and unit tests, can be obtained from github.,

    Welcome to , project pages
  , GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing the ,

        to access the secure communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and
        write X.509, PKCS #12, and other required structures.,The project strives to provide a secure communications back-end,
        , and integrated with the rest of the base Linux
        libraries. A back-end designed to work and be secure out of the box,
        keeping the complexity of TLS and PKI out of application code.

lz4,"LZ4,
        LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed > 500 MB/s per core (>0.15 Bytes/cycle).
        It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core (~1 Byte/cycle).
        A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for compression ratio.
        LZ4 library is provided as open source software using a BSD license.

          This benchmark simulates simple ""static content transfer"" scenario such as OS Kernel compression
          or video game's static assets (text/images/tables/scripts/etc) which loading from Flash Memory / HDD / SSD.
          ,
          In this case, compression time is completely ignored.
          Because only content developers compress the data at once and usually they don't care about its computational cost.
          But they always care enduser's experience a.k.a. ""loading time"" and bandwidth.
          ,
          Please pay attention to ""LZ4HC -9"" which is quite faster than other methods.
          ,
          This benchmark simulates ""dynamic content transfer"" scenario such as filesystems, caches, network packets, IPC/RPCs, and databases.
          ,
          In this case, both compression and decompression times are important.
          You can observe ""Fast compression algorithms"" are better than traditional algorithms such as DEFLATE (zlib).

, of source code is possible through several programs
such as ,, , or ,.
The included scripts
, and , are also usable derived from older programs found in the internet and tailored for the
use within lesspipe.
,
Syntax highlighting and other methods of colorizing the output are only
activated if the environment variable
LESS is existing and contains the option -R or less is called with -R.
This guarantees, that instead of literal escape sequences
colors are displayed. The detection of the -R presence at runtime is
rather dependent on the operating system and may not work in all cases.
,
The script lesspipe.sh needs a lot of helper programs that may or may not be
installed on your computer.
The , from version 2 on
interactively checks for the existence of these helper programs.
The script that does the colorization by default can be replaced by setting
the LESSCOLORIZER env variable to the desired colorizer.
,
Starting with version 2.01 , of files within archives is possible.
A colon or equal sign after the archive name followed by a tab key press
engages the completion mechanism (bash and zsh) if properly installed.
That requires the script , to be executable and to be found in $PATH and for zsh the script called , in one of the $fpath directories. For bash the , script needs to be installed in /etc/bashcompletion.d/.
,
The lesspipe.sh filtering can be replaced or enhanced  by a user defined
program. Such a program has to be called either , (and be placed in
the users home directory), or , (and be accessible from a directory
mentioned in the environment variable $PATH).
That program has to be executable and has to end with an exit code 0, if the
filtering was done within that script. Otherwise, a nonzero exit code means
the filtering is left to lesspipe.sh.

This mechanism can be used to add filtering for new formats or e.g. inhibit
filtering for certain file types.
,
To get support for newer file types an additional magic file (for use in the
file command, e.g. in ~/.magic) might have to be created. In that case the
environment variable MAGIC has to be set and has to contain both the system
magic file and your personal one. Example:,
MAGIC='/usr/share/file/magic:/Users/myaccount/.magic',
export MAGIC,

,This repository hosts source code implementing the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) TPM2 Software Stack (TSS).
This stack consists of the following layers from top to bottom:,Instructions to build and install tpm2-tss are available in the , file.,If you're looking to discuss the source code in this project or get some questions answered you should join the 01.org TPM2 mailing list:,We also have an IRC channel set up on , called #tpm2.0-tss.
You can also try Gitter ,You can join a weekly online call at ,, where we are discussing the tpm2-tss stack, the tpm2-pkcs11 project and other Linux TPM2 & TSS2-Software.,In case you want to contribute to the project, please also have a look at the ,.,The doxygen documentation can either be built by oneself (see the , file) or browsed directly on ,.,This repository contains a test suite intended to exercise the TCTI, SAPI and ESAPI code.
This test suite is , intended to test a TPM implementation, so this test suite should only be run against a TPM simulator.
If this test suite is executed against a TPM other than the software simulator it may cause damage to the TPM (NV storage wear out, etc.).
You have been warned.,The TPM library specification contains reference code sufficient to construct a software TPM 2.0 simulator.
This code was provided by Microsoft and they provide a binary download for Windows ,.,There are two implementations that enable building and running this code on Linux.
Issues building or running the simulator should be reported to respective project.,The Software TPM is an open-source TPM emulator with different front-end interfaces such as socket and character device. Its code is hosted , and building is faciliated by the GNU Autotools.
The TCTI module for using this simulator is called ,.,Since tpm2-tss v3.0 swtpm is the default simulator used by this project.,IBM has also repackaged this code with a few Makefiles so that the Microsoft code can be built and run on Linux systems.
The Linux version of the Microsoft TPM 2.0 simulator can be obtained
,.
Once you've downloaded and successfully built and execute the simulator it will, by default, be accepting connections on the localhost, TCP ports 2321 and 2322.
The TCTI module for using this simulator is called ,.,To test the various TCTI, SAPI and ESAPI api calls, unit and integration tests can
be run by configuring the build to enable unit testing and running the ""check""
build target. It is recommended to use a simulator for testing, and the
simulator will be automatically launched by the tests. Please review the
dependency list in , for dependencies when building
the test suite.,This will generate a file called ""test-suite.log"" in the root of the build
directory.,Please report failures in a Github 'issue' with a full log of the test run.,NOTE: The unit and integration tests can be enabled independently.
The --enable-unit option controls unit tests, and --enable-integration
controls the integration tests.,To run integration tests on a physical TPM device, including a TPM hardware
or a software TPM implemented in platform firmware the configure script
provides two options.
The first option is called --with-device and it is used to point to the TPM
device interface exposed by the OS, for example:,The second option, --with-devicetests, enables a ""class"" of test.
There are three classes:,For example to enable both mandatory and optional test cases during configure
one needs to set this flag as follows:,Tht default value for the flag is ""mandatory""
Any combination of the three is valid.
The two flags are only valid when the integration tests are enabled with
--enable-integration flag.,After that the following command is used to run the test on the configured
TPM device:,or,Note: The tests can not be run in paralel.,The unit and integration tests can be run under the valgrind tool, which
performs additional checks on the library and test code, such as memory
leak checks etc. The following command is used to run the tests under
valgrind:,$ make check-valgrind,This command will enable all valgrind ""tools"" and kick off as many test
as they support. It is possible to enable different valgrind
tools (checks) in more granularity. This can be controlled by invoking
different tools separately using check-valgrind-<tool>, for instance:,or,Currently the the following tools are supported:,memcheck - Performs memory related checks. This is the default tool.
helgrind - Performs synchronization errors checks.
drd      - Performs thread related checks.
sgcheck  - Performs stack overrun related checks.,Note that the valgring tool can also be invoked manually using the standard
libtool:,This allows for more control on what checks are performed.,While investigating issues it might be helpful to enable extra debug/trace
output. It can be enabled separately for different components.
The description how to do this can be found in the , file.,All system API function calls can be tested using a fuzzing library.

                            ,It is Browser color management check day! As some users asked for this, I am recovering an old test I posted in lcms blog many years ago. Basically, it uses special images with crafted embedded profiles. If profiles are correctly honored, a text will show up. But not all web browsers behave equally.
Here are the old tests. They only check V2 compatibility.
No surprises. The images are using embedded profiles to do the trick.,

,libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports a wide variety of both modern and historical hashing methods:
yescrypt, gost-yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, sha512crypt, sha256crypt,
md5crypt, SunMD5, sha1crypt, NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt, and descrypt.
It provides the traditional Unix , and , interfaces, as
well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by Openwall Linux,
,, ,, ,, ,, and
,.,libxcrypt is intended to be used by ,, ,, and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it , intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.,libxcrypt is currently maintained by Björn Esser and Zack Weinberg.
Many people have contributed to the code making up libxcrypt, often
under the aegis of a different project.  Please see the AUTHORS and
THANKS files for a full set of credits.,libxcrypt as a whole is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (version 2.1, or at your option, any later version).  However,
many individual files may be reused under more permissive licenses if
separated from the library.  Please see the LICENSING file for a
comprehensive inventory of licenses, and COPYING.LIB for the terms of
the LGPL.,libxcrypt is currently maintained at Github: the canonical repository
URL is ,.  Please file bug
reports at ,.  This is
also the appropriate place to suggest new features, offer patches,
etc.  All your feedback is welcome and will eventually receive a
response, but this is a spare-time project for all of the present
maintainers, so please be patient.,To build from a tarball release, the tools required are the standard
Unix shell environment, a C compiler, and Perl (version 5.14 or
later).  Follow the generic build and installation instructions in the
file ,.  There are several package-specific configure options;
run , for more detail on these options.
Run , for more detail on the hashing algorithms that
can be enabled or disabled by ,.  You can do both of
these things before building the software.,Building from a Git checkout additionally requires the Autotools
suite: ,, ,, ,, and ,.
Run , at the top level of the source tree, and then
follow the instructions in , (which is created by that command).,The oldest versions of Autotools components that are known to work
are: autoconf 2.69, automake 1.14, libtool 2.4.6, pkg-config 0.29.
If you test with an older version of one of these and find that it
works, please let us know.  We are not deliberately requiring newer
versions; we just can’t conveniently test older versions ourselves.,libxcrypt should be buildable with any ISO C1999-compliant C compiler,
with one critical exception: the symbol versioning macros in
, only work with compilers that implement certain GCC and
GNU Binutils extensions (,, GCC-style ,,
and ,).,A few C2011 features are used; the intention is not to use any of them
without a fallback, but we do not currently test this.  A few POSIX
and nonstandard-but-widespread Unix APIs are also used; again, the
intention is not to use any of them without a fallback, but we do not
currently test this.  In particular, the crypt_gensalt functions may
not always be able to retrieve cryptographically-sound random numbers
from the operating system; if you call these functions with a null
pointer for the “rbytes” argument, be prepared for them to fail.,As of mid-2018, GCC and LLVM don’t support link-time optimization of
libraries that use symbol versioning.  If you build libxcrypt with
either of these compilers, do not use ,.  See ,
for specifics; the problem is very similar for LLVM.  Because this is,
at its root, a set of missing compiler features, we expect link-time
optimization won’t work in other C compilers either, but we haven’t
tested it ourselves.,On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C
Library.  This means that all existing binary executables linked
against glibc’s libcrypt should work unmodified with this library’s
libcrypt.so.1.  We have taken pains to provide exactly the same symbol
versions as were used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to
account for the variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were
patched into glibc’s libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For
instance, compatibility symlinks for SUSE’s “libowcrypt” are provided.),However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc’s libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc’s libcrypt (,, ,,
,, ,, and ,) cannot be , against
libxcrypt.,Binary backward compatibility can be disabled by supplying the
, switch to ,, in which case libxcrypt
will install libcrypt.so.2 instead of libcrypt.so.1.  This
configuration is always used on all operating systems other than
Linux.  We are willing to consider adding binary backward
compatibility for other operating systems’ existing libcrypts, but we
don’t currently plan to do that work ourselves.,Individual hash functions may be enabled or disabled by use of the
, switch to ,.  The default is to enable all
supported hashes.  Disabling the traditional ‘des’ hash algorithm
implies ,.  Security-conscious environments
without backward compatibility constraints are encouraged to use
,, which enables only the hash functions that
are strong enough to be safe for newly hashed passwords.,The original implementation of the SunMD5 hashing algorithm has a bug,
which is mimicked by libxcrypt to be fully compatible with hashes
generated on (Open)Solaris.  According to the only existing
,, its hashes were supposed to have
the format ,, and include only the
bare string , in the salt digest
step. However, almost all hashes encountered in production
environments have the format ,
(note the double $$).  Unfortunately, it is not merely a cosmetic
difference: hashes of this format incorporate the first $ after the
salt within the salt digest step, so the resulting checksum is
different.  The documentation hints that this stems from a bug within
the production implementation’s parser.  This bug causes the
implementation to return ,-format hashes when passed a
configuration string that ends with ,.  It returns the intended
original format and checksum only if there is at least one letter
after the ,, e.g. ,.,The NT algorithm, in its original implementation, never came with any
, function, because the algorithm does not use any.  libxcrypt
ships a bogus , function for the NT algorithm, which simply
returns ,.,glibc’s libcrypt could optionally be configured to use Mozilla’s NSS
library’s implementations of the cryptographic primitives md5crypt,
sha256crypt, and sha512crypt.  This option is not available in
libxcrypt, because we do not currently believe it is a desirable
option.  The stated rationale for the option was to source all
cryptographic primitives from a library that has undergone FIPS
certification, but we believe FIPS certification would need to cover
all of libxcrypt itself to have any meaningful value.  Moreover, the
strongest hashing methods, yescrypt and bcrypt, use cryptographic
primitives that are not available from NSS, so the certification
would not cover any part of what will hopefully be the most used code
paths.,

fish.,If you're on a tmux session, you can start fzf in a tmux split-pane or in
a tmux popup window by setting , (e.g. ,).
See , for available options.,More tips can be found on ,.,Fuzzy completion for files and directories can be triggered if the word before

above, but instead of executing the command and coming back to fzf on

approach has several advantages:,To be fair, running , instead of ,
resolves all of the issues mentioned. Nonetheless, , still offers
additional benefits in different scenarios.,By binding , action to a key or an event, you can make fzf dynamically
reload the candidate list. See , for
more details.,The following example uses fzf as the selector interface for ripgrep. We bound
, action to , event, so every time you type on fzf, the ripgrep
process will restart with the updated query string denoted by the placeholder
expression ,. Also, note that we used , option so that fzf
doesn't perform any secondary filtering.,If ripgrep doesn't find any matches, it will exit with a non-zero exit status,
and fzf will warn you about it. To suppress the warning message, we added
, to the command, so that it always exits with 0.,See ,

with the current line as the argument and shows the result in the split window.
Your , is used to execute the command with ,.
The window can be scrolled using the mouse or custom key bindings.,Preview window supports ANSI colors, so you can use any program that

read-side critical section.,This is especially important to understand in the context of the
QSBR flavor: a registered reader thread being ""online"" by

section unless explicitly put ""offline"". Therefore, if
, is called with a mutex held, this mutex, as
well as any mutex which has this mutex in its dependency chain
should only be taken when the RCU reader thread is ""offline""
(this can be performed by calling ,).,Special care must be taken for applications performing , without
any following ,. This is caused by the fact that Linux only clones
the thread calling ,, and thus never replicates any of the other

More on that below.,Or download a binary from the , page. MacOS, Linux, Windows,
FreeBSD and OpenBSD binaries are available, as well as Debian, RPM, and Alpine
packages. ARM builds are also available for macOS, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.,Or just install it with ,:,Simply run , without arguments to start the textual user interface and

pressing ,.,Stashing is private, its contents will not be exposed publicly, and it's

It's forked from the open-sourced Windows version available originally from openal.org's SVN repository (now defunct).
OpenAL provides capabilities for playing audio in a virtual 3D environment. Distance attenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound emitters are among the features handled by the API. More advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion, and environmental reverb, are available through the EFX extension. It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers, and audio capture.,More information is available on the ,.,To install OpenAL Soft, use your favorite shell to go into the build/
directory, and run:,Alternatively, you can use any available CMake front-end, like cmake-gui,
ccmake, or your preferred IDE's CMake project parser.,Assuming configuration went well, you can then build it. The command
, will instruct CMake to build the project with the toolchain
chosen during configuration (often GNU Make or NMake, although others are
possible).,Please Note: Double check that the appropriate backends were detected. Often,
complaints of no sound, crashing, and missing devices can be solved by making
sure the correct backends are being used. CMake's output will identify which
backends were enabled.,For most systems, you will likely want to make sure PipeWire, PulseAudio, and
ALSA were detected (if your target system uses them). For Windows, make sure
WASAPI was detected.,You can download and install openal-soft using the , dependency manager:,The openal-soft port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please , on the vcpkg repository.,The source package comes with an informational utility, openal-info, and is
built by default. It prints out information provided by the ALC and AL sub-
systems, including discovered devices, version information, and extensions.,OpenAL Soft can be configured on a per-user and per-system basis. This allows
users and sysadmins to control information provided to applications, as well

libpipeline,"libpipeline - pipeline manipulation library,libpipeline is a C library for manipulating pipelines of subprocesses in
a flexible and convenient way.  It is available in at least the following
operating systems:,For macOS, you can install libpipeline using
, with
,.,When I took over , in 2001,
one of the major problems that became evident after maintaining it for a
while was the way it handled subprocesses.  The nature of man and friends
means that it spends a lot of time calling sequences of programs such as
,.  Back then,
it was using C library facilities such as , and
, for all this, and I had to deal with several bugs where
those functions were being called with untrusted input as arguments without
properly escaping metacharacters.  Of course it was possible to chase around
every such call inserting appropriate escaping functions, but this was
always bound to be error-prone and one of the tasks that rapidly became
important to me was arranging to start subprocesses in a way that was
fundamentally immune to this kind of bug.,In higher-level languages, there are usually standard constructs which
are safer than just passing a command line to the shell.  For example, in
Perl you can use , to
invoke a program with arguments without the interference of the shell, and
, describes various facilities for connecting them
together.  In Python, the
,
module allows you to create pipelines easily and safely (as long as you
remember the
,).  C has the , and ,
primitives, but assembling these to construct full-blown pipelines correctly
is difficult and error-prone, so many programmers don't bother and use the
simple but unsafe library facilities instead.,libpipeline solves this problem.  In the following examples, function
names starting with , or , are real
functions in the library, while any other function names are pseudocode.,Constructing the simplified example pipeline from my first paragraph
using this library looks like this:,You might want to construct a command more dynamically:,Perhaps you want an environment variable set only while running a certain
command:,You might find yourself needing to pass the output of one pipeline to
several other pipelines, in a ""tee"" arrangement:,Maybe one of your commands is actually an in-process function, rather
than an external program:,Sometimes your program needs to consume the output of a pipeline, rather
than sending it all to some other subprocess:,See the
,

,.,If your distribution includes a package of libpipeline, it's usually best
to install that.  However, if you need to install it starting from source

, is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, AVX2, Neon, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, Arm, and PowerPC systems, as well as progressive JPEG
compression on x86, x86-64, and Arm systems.  On such systems, , is generally 2-6x as fast as ,, all else being equal.  On other types of systems, , can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines.  In many cases, the performance of
, rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.
, implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API.  , also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.
, was originally based on ,, an MMX-accelerated derivative of libjpeg v6b developed by Miyasaka Masaru.  The TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec in 2009, and in early 2010, , spun off into an independent project, with the goal of making high-speed JPEG compression/decompression technology available to a broader range of users and developers.

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace programs
to export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. The FUSE project consists
of two components: the , kernel module (maintained in the regular
kernel repositories) and the , userspace library (maintained
in this repository). libfuse provides the reference implementation
for communicating with the FUSE kernel module.,A FUSE file system is typically implemented as a standalone
application that links with libfuse. libfuse provides functions to
mount the file system, unmount it, read requests from the kernel, and
send responses back. libfuse offers two APIs: a ""high-level"",
synchronous API, and a ""low-level"" asynchronous API. In both cases,
incoming requests from the kernel are passed to the main program using
callbacks. When using the high-level API, the callbacks may work with
file names and paths instead of inodes, and processing of a request
finishes when the callback function returns. When using the low-level
API, the callbacks must work with inodes and responses must be sent
explicitly using a separate set of API functions.,libfuse is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in
production use across a wide range of systems for many years. However,
at present libfuse does not have any active, regular contributors. The
current maintainer continues to apply pull requests and makes regular
releases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development
beyond addressing high-impact issues. When reporting bugs, please
understand that unless you are including a pull request or are
reporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response. If
you are using libfuse, please consider contributing to the project.,You can download libfuse from

Python module. Instead of running the tests as root, the majority of
tests can also be run as a regular user if , is made
setuid root first:,The , program is installed setuid root. This is done to
allow normal users to mount their own filesystem implementations.,To limit the harm that malicious users can do this way, ,
enforces the following limitations:,The user can only mount on a mountpoint for which they have write
permission,The mountpoint must not be a sticky directory which isn't owned by
the user (like /tmp usually is),No other user (including root) can access the contents of the
mounted filesystem (though this can be relaxed by allowing the use
of the , and , mount options in
,),If you intend to use the , mount options, be aware that
FUSE has an unresolved ,: if the
, mount option is not used, the results of the
first permission check performed by the file system for a directory
entry will be re-used for subsequent accesses as long as the inode of
the accessed entry is present in the kernel cache - even if the
permissions have since changed, and even if the subsequent access is
made by a different user. This is of little concern if the filesystem
is accessible only to the mounting user (which has full access to the
filesystem anyway), but becomes a security issue when other users are
allowed to access the filesystem (since they can exploit this to
perform operations on the filesystem that they do not actually have
permissions for).,This bug needs to be fixed in the Linux kernel and has been known
since 2006 but unfortunately no fix has been applied yet. If you
depend on correct permission handling for FUSE file systems, the only
workaround is to use , (which does not currently
support ACLs), or to completely disable caching of directory entry
attributes.,FUSE comes with several example file systems in the ,
directory. For example, the , examples mirror the contents
of the root directory under the mountpoint. Start from there and adapt
the code!,The documentation of the API functions and necessary callbacks is
mostly contained in the files , (for the high-level
API) and , (for the low-level API). An
autogenerated html version of the API is available in the ,

Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified in ,. This is the latest version of
the protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.,This library also provides support for Unicode Technical
Standard 46, ,.,This acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”
module that comes with the Python standard library, but which
only supports the older superseded IDNA specification (,).,Basic functions are simply executed:,This package is available for installation from PyPI:,For typical usage, the , and , functions will take a
domain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels
respectively.,You may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the
, module:,Conversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the , or
, functions if necessary:,As described in ,, the
IDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential
ways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as
a “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local
user-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.,This library provides one such mapping, that was developed by the
Unicode Consortium. Known as ,, it provides for both a regular
mapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to
help migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.,For example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as , is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).
UTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA
conversion.,Transitional processing provides conversions to help transition from
the older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the
original IDNA specification, the , (ß) was
converted into two , (ss), whereas in the current
IDNA specification this conversion is not performed.,Implementors should use transitional processing with caution, only in
rare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be
performed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical
applications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing
is unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible
results.,Function calls from the Python built-in , module are
mapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the , module.
Simply substitute the , clause in your code to refer to the new
module name.,All errors raised during the conversion following the specification
should raise an exception derived from the , base
class.,More specific exceptions that may be generated as ,
when the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and
right-to-left characters in a label; , when
a specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.
INVALID); and , when the codepoint is
illegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ
but the contextual requirements are not satisfied.),The IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup
tables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against
eligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are
computed using the command-line script ,.,This tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository
and perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are
three main modes:,The tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ,. Most notably, the , argument allows the specification
of the version of Unicode to use in computing the table data. For
example, , will generate
library data against Unicode 9.0.0.,

,A library to automatically generate and run simple argparse parsers from function signatures.,Autocommand is installed via pip:,Autocommand turns a function into a command-line program. It converts the function's parameter signature into command-line arguments, and automatically runs the function if the module was called as ,. In effect, it lets your create a smart main function.,As you can see, autocommand converts the signature of the function into an argument spec. When you run the file as a program, autocommand collects the command-line arguments and turns them into function arguments. The function is executed with these arguments, and then the program exits with the return value of the function, via ,. Autocommand also automatically creates a usage message, which can be invoked with , or ,, and automatically prints an error message when provided with invalid arguments.,You can use a type annotation to give an argument a type. Any type (or in fact any callable) that returns an object when given a string argument can be used, though there are a few special cases that are described later.,Autocommand will catch , raised by the type during argument parsing, so you can supply a callable and do some basic argument validation as well.,You can add a , parameter to your function to give it trailing arguments. The command will collect 0 or more trailing arguments and supply them to , as a tuple. If a type annotation is supplied, the type is applied to each argument.,To create , switches, just assign a default. Autocommand will automatically create , and ,hort switches.,The option's type is automatically deduced from the default, unless one is explicitly given in an annotation:,If an option is given a default value of ,, it reads in a value as normal, but supplies , if the option isn't provided.,If an argument is given a default value of , or ,, or
given an explicit , type, it becomes an option switch.,Autocommand attempts to do the ""correct thing"" in these cases- if the default is ,, then supplying the switch makes the argument ,; if the type is , and the default is some other , value, then supplying the switch makes the argument ,, while not supplying the switch makes the argument the default value.,Autocommand also supports the creation of switch inverters. Pass , to , to enable this.,Using the , version of a switch will pass the opposite value in as a function argument. If multiple switches are present, the last one takes precedence.,If the default value is a file object, such as ,, then autocommand just looks for a string, for a file path. It doesn't do any special checking on the string, though (such as checking if the file exists); it's better to let the client decide how to handle errors in this case. Instead, it provides a special context manager called ,, which behaves exactly like , if a filename or other openable type is provided, but also lets you use already open files:,The , decorator accepts , and , kwargs, corresponding to the ,_ and ,_ of the ,. If no description is given, but the decorated function has a docstring, then it is taken as the , for the ,. You can also provide both the description and epilog in the docstring by splitting it into two sections with 4 or more - characters.,You can also attach description text to individual parameters in the annotation. To attach both a type and a description, supply them both in any order in a tuple,Autocommand automatically follows wrapper chains created by ,. This means that you can apply other wrapping decorators to your main function, and autocommand will still correctly detect the signature.,Even though autocommand is being applied to the , returned by ,, it still retreives the signature of the underlying , function to create the argument parsing.,While autocommand's automatic parser generator is a powerful convenience, it doesn't cover all of the different features that argparse provides. If you need these features, you can provide your own parser as a kwarg to ,:,Any parser should work fine, so long as each of the parser's arguments has a corresponding parameter in the decorated main function. The order of parameters doesn't matter, as long as they are all present. Note that when using a custom parser, autocommand doesn't modify the parser or the retrieved arguments. This means that no description/epilog will be added, and the function's type annotations and defaults (if present) will be ignored.,The decorated function is only called and exited from if the first argument to , is , or ,. If it is neither of these values, or no argument is given, then a new main function is created by the decorator. This function has the signature ,, and is intended to be called with arguments as if via ,. The function has the attributes , and ,, which are the generated , and the original main function that was decorated. This is to facilitate testing and library use of your main. Calling the function triggers a , with the supplied arguments, and returns the result of the main function. Note that, while it returns instead of calling ,, the , function will raise a , in the event of a parsing error or , argument.,If the function is called with no arguments, , is used. This is to allow the autocommand function to be used as a setuptools entry point.,There are a few possible exceptions that , can raise. All of them derive from ,.,There are a few argparse features that are not supported by autocommand.,Autocommand cannot be important from the project root; this is to enforce separation of concerns and prevent accidental importing of , or tests. To develop, install the project in editable mode:,This will create a link to the source files in the deployment directory, so that any source changes are reflected when it is imported.,

,To compile x265 you must first install Git and , 2.8.8 or later.
To ensure your build of x265 is capable of full performance, install
, 1.2.0 or newer if you are using x265 v2.6 or older, or
, 2.13 or newer if you are compiling from the default branch to compile
assembly primitives.  Then follow these easy steps:,For detailed instructions, consult our build ,.  Basic instructions are outlined below.,The primary target that we support is x86. x265 can also be built on linux platforms on ARM and POWERPC targets using the same build insructions above
(exclude yasm from the list of packages on these targets). Our support for these platforms is growing as our user base on these platforms increase.,We also support cross-compilation for ARM targets from linux platforms on x86 targets by using the g++ arm cross-compiler. This has been tested on Ubuntu linux
14.04 running on an x86 CPU. On other distributions, package names and names of cross compilation tools may differ. This is an experimental feature, and has undergone very limited testing. ,Then run make-solutions.bat in the build\ folder that corresponds to
your favorite compiler, configure your build options, click 'configure',
click 'generate', then close cmake-gui.  You will be rewarded with an
x265.sln file.  Also see ,
documentation.,The latest Mac OS X 10.8 gcc and clang based compilers can build x265
using the , instructions above.  Xcode 5 with the most recent
patches can build, debug, and profile x265.,On Windows, after installing the Intel C-compiler, right-click on the 'Solution x265'
inside the solution explorer window, select 'Intel Compiler -> Use Intel C++', and
rebuild x265.,On Linux, you can tell cmake to build Makefiles for icpc directly.  This
requires you to have configured the Intel compiler environment (by
sourcing the appropriate shell script). For example:,Applications like ffmpeg and the x265 CLI which use our bit-depth
introspection API (x265_api_get) instead of the globally exported C
interface can select between 8 and 10bit libx265 libraries at runtime.
To support this both libraries must be available either as shared
libraries or as a pair of static libraries.,For shared libraries, just rename your 10bit libx265 as
libx265_main10.[so|dll|dylib] and place it into your library load path.,For static libraries, you must disable the exported C APIs, since they
would conflict with each other.   For linux/Mac, you can use or adapt
the build/linux/multilib.sh script.  For Windows, there are similar
vc*-x86_64/multilib.bat files that demonstrate how combined static
libraries can be built.,See also ,.,The Makefile/solution builds a static encoder.lib library and a standalone

libsndfile,"Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound
(such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard
library interface. It is released in source code format under the
,.,The library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but should compile
and run on just about any Unix (including MacOS X).
There are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit windows.,It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian (such
as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on little-endian (such as Intel
and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems as well as big-endian processor systems
such as Motorola 68k, Power PC, MIPS and Sparc. Hopefully the design of the
library will also make it easy to extend for reading and writing new sound file
formats.,It has been compiled and tested (at one time or another) on the following
systems:,At the moment, each new release is being tested on i386 Linux, x86_64 Linux,
PowerPC Linux, Win32 and Win64.,libsndfile has the following main features :,libsndfile has a comprehensive test suite so that each release is as bug free
as possible.
When new bugs are found, new tests are added to the test suite to ensure that
these bugs don’t creep back into the code.
When new features are added, tests are added to the test suite to make sure that
these features continue to work correctly even when they are old features.,My first attempt at reading and writing WAV files was in 1990 or so under
Windows 3.1. I started using Linux in early 1995 and contributed some code to
the , program. That
contributed code would eventually mutate into this library. As one of my
interests is Digital Signal Processing (DSP) I decided that as well as reading
data from an audio file in the native format (typically 16 bit short integers)
it would also be useful to be able to have the library do the conversion to
floating point numbers for DSP applications. It then dawned on me that whatever
file format (anything from 8 bit unsigned chars, to 32 bit floating point
numbers) the library should be able to convert the data to whatever format the
library user wishes to use it in. For example, in a sound playback program, the
library caller typically wants the sound data in 16 bit short integers to dump
into a sound card even though the data in the file may be 32 bit floating point
numbers (ie Microsoft’s WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT format). Another example would be
someone doing speech recognition research who has recorded some speech as a 16
bit WAV file but wants to process it as double precision floating point numbers.,Here is the release history for libsndfile:,libsndfile is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
of which there are two versions;
,
and
,.
To maximise the compatibility of libsndfile, the user may choose to use
libsndfile under either of the above two licenses.
You can also read a simple explanation of the ideas behind the GPL and the LGPL
,.,You can use libsndfile with
,,
,,
proprietary, shareware or other closed source applications as long as libsndfile
is used as a dynamically loaded library and you abide by a small number of other
conditions (read the LGPL for more info).
With applications released under the GNU GPL you can also use libsndfile
statically linked to your application.,I would like to see libsndfile used as widely as possible but I would prefer it
if you released software that uses libsndfile as
,
or
,.
However, if you put in a great deal of effort building a significant application
which simply uses libsndfile for file I/O, then I have no problem with you
releasing that as closed source and charging as much money as you want for it as
long as you abide by ,.,Check latest version on

,Frequently Asked Questions,Problem statement: Applications suck at correctly and consistently supporting proxy configuration.,Proxy configuration is problematic for a number of reasons:,These issues make programming with support for proxies hard. Application developers only want to answer the question: Given a network resource, how do I reach it? Because this is their concern, most applications just give up and try to read the proxy from an environment variable. This is problematic because:,1 Given the increased use of mobile computing, network switching frequently occurs during the lifetime of an application

platforms.  Unlike the LZW compression method used in Unix ,(1)
and in the GIF image format, the compression method currently used in zlib
essentially never expands the data.  (LZW can double or triple the file size in
extreme cases.)  zlib's memory footprint is also independent of the input data

GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
processor. It is mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some
extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
macros). GNU M4 also has built-in functions for including files,
running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.
,
GNU M4 is a macro processor in the sense that it copies its input to
the output expanding macros as it goes.  Macros are either builtin or
user-defined and can take any number of arguments. Besides just doing
macro expansion, m4 has builtin functions for including named files,
running UNIX commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in
various ways, recursion etc... m4 can be used either as a front-end to
a compiler or as a macro processor in its own right.

wpa_supplicant,"wpa_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant for Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and
Windows with
support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). It is suitable for both
desktop/laptop computers and embedded systems. Supplicant is the IEEE
802.1X/WPA component that is used in the client stations. It
implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls
the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan
driver.,wpa_supplicant is designed to be a ""daemon"" program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling the wireless
connection. wpa_supplicant supports separate frontend programs and a
text-based frontend (wpa_cli) and a GUI (wpa_gui) are included with
wpa_supplicant.,wpa_supplicant uses a flexible build configuration that can be used
to select which features are included. This allows minimal code size
(from ca. 50 kB binary for WPA/WPA2-Personal and 130 kB binary for
WPA/WPA2-Enterprise without debugging code to 450 kB with most
features and full debugging support; these example sizes are from a
build for x86 target).,Following methods are also supported, but since they do not generate keying
material, they cannot be used with WPA or IEEE 802.1X WEP keying.,More information about EAP methods and interoperability testing is
available in ,.,wpa_supplicant was designed to be portable for different drivers and
operating systems. Hopefully, support for more wlan cards and OSes will be
added in the future. See ,
for more information about the design of wpa_supplicant and porting to
other drivers.,

has some more information about the Windows port of wpa_supplicant.,The original security mechanism of IEEE 802.11 standard was not
designed to be strong and has proven to be insufficient for most
networks that require some kind of security. Task group I (Security)
of ,
has worked to address the flaws of the base standard and in
practice completed its work in May 2004. The IEEE 802.11i amendment to
the IEEE 802.11 standard was approved in June 2004 and published in
July 2004., used a draft
version of the IEEE 802.11i work (draft 3.0) to define a subset of the
security enhancements that can be implemented with existing wlan
hardware. This is called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). This has
now become a mandatory component of interoperability testing and
certification done by Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi has
, at its web site.,IEEE 802.11 standard defined wired equivalent privacy (WEP) algorithm
for protecting wireless networks. WEP uses RC4 with 40-bit keys,
24-bit initialization vector (IV), and CRC32 to protect against packet
forgery. All these choices have proven to be insufficient: key space is
too small against current attacks, RC4 key scheduling is insufficient
(beginning of the pseudorandom stream should be skipped), IV space is
too small and IV reuse makes attacks easier, there is no replay
protection, and non-keyed authentication does not protect against bit
flipping packet data.,WPA is an intermediate solution for the security issues. It uses
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to replace WEP. TKIP is a
compromise on strong security and possibility to use existing
hardware. It still uses RC4 for the encryption like WEP, but with
per-packet RC4 keys. In addition, it implements replay protection,
keyed packet authentication mechanism (Michael MIC).,Keys can be managed using two different mechanisms. WPA can either use
an external authentication server (e.g., RADIUS) and EAP just like
IEEE 802.1X is using or pre-shared keys without need for additional
servers. Wi-Fi calls these ""WPA-Enterprise"" and ""WPA-Personal"",
respectively. Both mechanisms will generate a master session key for
the Authenticator (AP) and Supplicant (client station).,WPA implements a new key handshake (4-Way Handshake and Group Key
Handshake) for generating and exchanging data encryption keys between
the Authenticator and Supplicant. This handshake is also used to
verify that both Authenticator and Supplicant know the master session
key. These handshakes are identical regardless of the selected key
management mechanism (only the method for generating master session
key changes).,The design for parts of IEEE 802.11i that were not included in WPA
has finished (May 2004) and this amendment to IEEE 802.11 was approved
in June 2004. Wi-Fi Alliance is using the final IEEE 802.11i as a new
version of WPA called WPA2. This included, e.g., support for more
robust encryption algorithm (CCMP: AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC)
to replace TKIP, optimizations for handoff (reduced number of messages
in initial key handshake, pre-authentication, and PMKSA caching).,Following steps are used when associating with an AP using WPA:,
,wpa_supplicant is configured using a text file that lists all accepted
networks and security policies, including pre-shared keys. See
example configuration file,
,,
for detailed information about the configuration format and supported
fields. In addition, simpler example configurations are available for
,,

,.
In addition, wpa_supplicant can use OpenSSL engine to avoid need for
exposing private keys in the file system. This can be used for EAP-TLS
authentication with smartcards and TPM tokens.

gpgme,"
, (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to
GnuPG easier for applications.  It provides a High-Level Crypto API
for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
management.  Currently it uses GnuPG's OpenPGP backend as the
default, but the API isn't restricted to this engine.  We have, in
fact, already developed a backend for CMS (S/MIME).
,
Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a
complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software
should try to use GPGME instead.  This way bug fixes or improvements
can be done at a central place and every application benefits from
this.  Furthermore, there is no guarentee that any particular
command line option will remain exactly the same at any given point
,
Especially authors of , should consider using GPGME.

, is, in a nutshell, the core rendering algorithms and ideas of
, rewritten as an independent library. As of today,
libplacebo contains a large assortment of video processing shaders, focusing
on both quality and performance. These include features such as the following:,Every attempt was made to provide these features at a ,, taking away all the messy details of GPU programming, color
spaces, obscure subsampling modes, image metadata manipulation, and so on.
Expert-level functionality is packed into easy-to-use functions like
, and ,.,libplacebo currently supports Vulkan (including MoltenVK), OpenGL, and
Direct3D 11. It currently has the following minimum hardware requirements:,For more documentation, including an introduction to the API, see ,.,This screenshot from the included ,
highlights just some of the features supported by the libplacebo rendering
code, all of which are adjustable dynamically during video playback.,This project grew out of an interest to accomplish the following goals:,It has since been adopted by , as their
optional Vulkan-based video output path, and is provided as a Vulkan-based
video filter in the FFmpeg project.,The public API of libplacebo is currently split up into the following
components, the header files (and documentation) for which are available
inside the , directory. The
API is available in different ""tiers"", representing levels of abstraction
inside libplacebo. The APIs in higher tiers depend on those in lower tiers.
Which tier is used by a user depends on how much power/control they want over
the actual rendering. The low-level tiers are more suitable for big projects
that need strong control over the entire rendering pipeline; whereas the
high-level tiers are more suitable for smaller or simpler projects that want
libplacebo to take care of everything.,The API functions in this tier are either used throughout the program
(context, common etc.) or are low-level implementations of filter kernels,
color space conversion logic etc.; which are entirely independent of GLSL
and even the GPU in general.,As part of the public API, libplacebo exports a middle-level abstraction for
dealing with GPU objects and state. Basically, this is the API libplacebo uses
internally to wrap OpenGL, Vulkan, Direct3D etc. into a single unifying API
subset that abstracts away state, messy details, synchronization etc. into a
fairly high-level API suitable for libplacebo's image processing tasks.,It's made public both because it constitutes part of the public API of various
image processing functions, but also in the hopes that it will be useful for
other developers of GPU-accelerated image processing software.,In addition to this low-level interface, there are several available shader
routines which libplacebo exports:,This shader dispatch mechanism is designed to be combined with the shader
processing routines exported by ,, but takes care of the low-level
translation of the resulting , objects into legal GLSL. It also
takes care of resource binding, shader input placement, as well as shader
caching and resource pooling; and makes sure all generated shaders have unique
identifiers (so they can be freely merged together).,This is the ""primary"" interface to libplacebo, and the one most users will be
interested in. It takes care of internal details such as degrading to simpler
algorithms depending on the hardware's capabilities, combining the correct
sequence of colorspace transformations and shader passes in order to get the
best overall image quality, and so forth.,libplacebo was founded and primarily developed by Niklas Haas
(,), but it would not be possible without the
contributions of others. Special note also goes out to wm4, the developer of
mpv, whose ideas helped shape the foundation of the shader dispatch system.
This library also includes various excerpts from mpv, in particular the filter
kernel code. For a full list of past contributors to mpv, see the ,Thank you to all our backers! , [,],Support this project by becoming a sponsor. Your logo will show up here with a link to your website. [,],

,libplacebo is currently available under the terms of the LGPLv2.1 (or later)
license. However, it's possible to release it under a more permissive license
(e.g. BSD2) if a use case emerges.,Please open an issue if you have a use case for a BSD2-licensed libplacebo.,When cloning libplacebo, make sure to provide the `--recursive``` flag:,Alternatively (on an existing clone):,Doing either of these pulls in a handful of bundled 3rdparty dependencies.
Alternatively, they can be provided via the system.,libplacebo is built using the ,.
You can build the project using the following steps:,To rebuild the project on changes, re-run ,. If you wish to
install the build products to the configured prefix (typically ,),

except for developers who know what they're doing. Regular users should rely
on distro packages.,In principle, libplacebo has no mandatory dependencies - only optional ones.
However, to get a useful version of libplacebo. you most likely want to build
with support for either ,, , or ,. libplacebo built without
these can still be used (e.g. to generate GLSL shaders such as the ones used in
VLC), but the usefulness is severely impacted since most components will be

companies started calling their type engines all things ending in Type:
FreeType, CoolType, ClearType, etc. And then came OpenType, which is the
successor of TrueType. So, for my OpenType implementation, I decided to stick
with the concept but use the Persian translation. Which is fitting given that
Persian is written in the Arabic script, and OpenType is an extension of
TrueType that adds support for complex script rendering, and HarfBuzz is an
implementation of OpenType complex text shaping.,

default. If an :ascii_only option with a true value is given, they escape all
non-ASCII and control characters with \uXXXX escape sequences, and support
UTF-16 surrogate pairs in order to be able to generate the whole range of
unicode code points.,All strings, that are to be encoded as JSON strings, should be UTF-8 byte
sequences on the Ruby side. To encode raw binary strings, that aren't UTF-8
encoded, please use the to_json_raw_object method of String (which produces
an object, that contains a byte array) and decode the result on the receiving
endpoint.,It's recommended to use the extension variant of JSON, because it's faster than
the pure ruby variant. If you cannot build it on your system, you can settle
for the latter.,Just type into the command line as root:,The above command will build the extensions and install them on your system.,or,will just install the pure ruby implementation of JSON.,If you use Rubygems you can type,instead, to install the newest JSON version.,There is also a pure ruby json only variant of the gem, that can be installed
with:,If you want to create the , file from its , file or draw nice
graphviz images of the state machines, you need ,.,To use JSON you can,to load the installed variant (either the extension , or the pure

pick either the extension variant or the pure variant by typing,or,Now you can parse a JSON document into a ruby data structure by calling,If you want to generate a JSON document from a ruby data structure call,You can also use the , method (which formats the output more
verbosely and nicely) or , (which doesn't do any of the security
checks generate performs, e. g. nesting deepness checks).,There are also the JSON and JSON[] methods which use parse on a String or
generate a JSON document from an array or hash:,and,You can choose to load a set of common additions to ruby core's objects if
you,After requiring this you can, e. g., serialise/deserialise Ruby ranges:,To find out how to add JSON support to other or your own classes, read the
section ""More Examples"" below.,To get the best compatibility to rails' JSON implementation, you can,Both of the additions attempt to require , (like above) first, if it has
not been required yet.,The JSON module doesn't extend , by default. If you convert an ,
object to JSON, it will by default only include the exception message.,To include the full details, you must either load the , mentioned
above, or specifically load the exception addition:,To create a JSON document from a ruby data structure, you can call
, like that:,To get back a ruby data structure from a JSON document, you have to call
JSON.parse on it:,Note, that the range from the original data structure is a simple
string now. The reason for this is, that JSON doesn't support ranges
or arbitrary classes. In this case the json library falls back to call
,, which is the same as ,.,It's possible to add JSON support serialization to arbitrary classes by
simply implementing a more specialized version of the ,, that
should return a JSON object (a hash converted to JSON with ,) like
this (don't forget the , for all the arguments):,The hash key , is the class, that will be asked to deserialise the
JSON representation later. In this case it's ,, but any namespace of
the form , or , will do. All other keys are arbitrary and can be
used to store the necessary data to configure the object to be deserialised.,If the key , is found in a JSON object, the JSON parser checks
if the given class responds to the , class method. If so, it is
called with the JSON object converted to a Ruby hash. So a range can
be deserialised by implementing , like this:,Now it possible to serialise/deserialise ranges as well:, always creates the shortest possible string representation of a
ruby data structure in one line. This is good for data storage or network
protocols, but not so good for humans to read. Fortunately there's also
, (or ,) that creates a more readable
output:,There are also the methods , for generate, and , for
, output to the console, that work analogous to Core Ruby's , and
the , library's , methods.,The script , contains a small example if you want to test, how
receiving a JSON object from a webrick server in your browser with the
JavaScript prototype library , works.,I have created some benchmark results (see the benchmarks/data-p4-3Ghz
subdir of the package) for the JSON-parser to estimate the speed up in the C
extension:,In the table above 1 is ,, 2 is , with YAML
compatible JSON document, 3 is is ,, and 4 is
,. The ActiveSupport JSON-decoder converts the
input first to YAML and then uses the YAML-parser, the conversion seems to
slow it down so much that it is only as fast as the ,!,If you look at the benchmark data you can see that this is mostly caused by
the frequent high outliers - the median of the Rails-parser runs is still
overall smaller than the median of the , runs:,I have benchmarked the , as well. This generated a few more
values, because there are different modes that also influence the achieved
speed:,In the table above 1-3 are , methods. 4, 6, and 7 are
, methods and 5 is the Rails JSON generator. It is now a
bit faster than the , and , methods of the pure
variant but slower than the others.,To achieve the fastest JSON document output, you can use the ,
method. Beware, that this will disable the checking for circular Ruby data
structures, which may cause JSON to go into an infinite loop.,Here are the median comparisons for completeness' sake:,Update the json.gemspec and json-java.gemspec.,Florian Frank ,Ruby License, see ,.,The latest version of this library can be downloaded at,Online Documentation should be located at,

pkgconf,"pkgconf , is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for
development libraries.  It is similar to pkg-config from freedesktop.org., is a library which provides access to most of ,'s functionality,
to allow other tooling such as compilers and IDEs to discover and use libraries
configured by pkgconf.,Implementations of pkg-config, such as pkgconf, are typically used with the
PKG_CHECK_MODULES autoconf macro.  As far as we know, pkgconf is
compatible with all known variations of this macro. pkgconf detects at
runtime whether or not it was started as 'pkg-config', and if so, attempts
to set program options such that its behaviour is similar.,In terms of the autoconf macro, it is possible to specify the PKG_CONFIG
environment variable, so that you can test pkgconf without overwriting your
pkg-config binary.  Some other build systems may also respect the PKG_CONFIG
environment variable.,To set the environment variable on the bourne shell and clones (i.e. bash), you
can run:,pkgconf builds an acyclic directed dependency graph.  This allows for the user
to more conservatively link their binaries -- which may be helpful in some
environments, such as when prelink(1) is being used.  As a result of building
a directed dependency graph designed for the specific problem domain provided
by the user, more accurate dependencies can be determined.,Current release versions of pkg-config, on the other hand, build a database of all
known pkg-config files on the system before attempting to resolve dependencies, which
is a considerably slower and less efficient design.  Efforts have been made recently
to improve this behaviour.,As of the 1.1 series, pkgconf also fully implements support for , rules,
while pkg-config does not.  pkg-config only provides the , functionality
as a stub.  There are other intentional implementation differences in pkgconf's dependency
resolver versus pkg-config's dependency resolver in terms of completeness and correctness,
such as, for example, how , rules are processed.,As previously mentioned, pkgconf makes optimizations to the linker flags in both the
case of static and shared linking in order to avoid overlinking binaries and also
simplifies the , and , output of the pkgconf tool for improved readability.,This functionality depends on the pkg-config module properly declaring it's dependency
tree instead of using , and , fields to directly link against other modules
which have pkg-config metadata files installed.,Doing so is discouraged by the , anyway.,I really hate that I have to have this section, I like being a nice person, but we
unfortunately have to say this because otherwise we get passive-aggressive people who
try to argue with us about what pkg-config compatibility means.,We do not provide bug-level compatibility with pkg-config.,What that means is, if you feel that there is a legitimate regression versus pkg-config,
do let us know, but also make sure that the .pc files are valid and follow the rules of
the ,, as most likely fixing them to follow the specified
rules will solve the problem.,Additionally, ,.,If, for example, you use environment variables such as ,
and then find yourself surprised that , is stripping , and , flags relating
to those paths, it is not a , problem -- , is doing exactly what you told
it to do.,We will reject bugs like this, and if someone insists on fixing such a non-bug, this
constitutes a violation of our ,, which may be
addressed by banning from this repository.,Please use only the stable interfaces to query pkg-config.  Do not screen-scrape the
output from ,: this is sent to , for a reason, it is not intended to be
scraped.  The , output is , a stable interface, and should , be
depended on as a source of information.  If you need a stable interface to query pkg-config
which is not covered, please get in touch.,pkgconf is basically compiled the same way any other autotools-based project is
compiled:,If you are installing pkgconf into a custom prefix, such as ,, you will
likely want to define the default system includedir and libdir for your toolchain.
To do this, use the , and , configure
flags like so:,pkgconf is compiled using , on Windows. In theory, you could also use
Meson to build on UNIX, but this is not recommended at this time as it pkgconf is typically built
much earlier than Meson.,There are a few defines such as SYSTEM_LIBDIR, PKGCONFIGDIR and SYSTEM_INCLUDEDIR.
However, on Windows, the default PKGCONFIGDIR value is usually overridden at runtime based
on path relocation.,If you want pkgconf to be used when you invoke ,, you should install a
symlink for this.  We do not do this for you, as we believe it is better for vendors
to make this determination themselves.,Release tarballs are available at ,.

released under the ,.,librsync is a library for calculating and applying network deltas, with an
interface designed to ease integration into diverse network applications.,librsync encapsulates the core algorithms of the rsync protocol, which help
with efficient calculation of the differences between two files. The rsync
algorithm is different from most differencing algorithms because it does not
require the presence of the two files to calculate the delta.  Instead, it
requires a set of checksums of each block of one file, which together form a
signature for that file.  Blocks at any position in the other file which have the same
checksum are likely to be identical, and whatever remains is the difference.,This algorithm transfers the differences between two files without needing
both files on the same system.,librsync is for building other programs that transfer files as efficiently as
rsync. You can use librsync in a program you write to do backups, distribute
binary patches to programs, or sync directories to a server or between peers.,This tree also produces the \ref page_rdiff that exposes the key operations of
librsync: generating file signatures, generating the delta from a signature to
a new file, and applying the delta to regenerate the new file given the old
file.,librsync was originally written for the rproxy experiment in delta-compression
for HTTP. librsync is used by: ,,

cannot make use of librsync to talk to an rsync server.,librsync does not deal with file metadata or structure, such as filenames,
permissions, or directories. To this library, a file is just a stream of
bytes. Higher-level tools can deal with such issues in a way appropriate to
their users.,librsync also does not include any network functions for talking to SSH or
any other server. To access a remote filesystem, you need to provide your own

    News
  ,
    A new major release, ,,
    is now available for download. This release has many new encoders and decoders, filters,
    ffmpeg CLI tool improvements, and also, changes the way releases are done. All major
    releases will now bump the version of the ABI. We plan to have a new major release each
    year. Another release-specific change is that deprecated APIs will be removed after 3
    releases, upon the next major bump.
    This means that releases will be done more often and will be more organized.
  ,
    New decoders featured are Bonk, RKA, Radiance, SC-4, APAC, VQC, WavArc and a few ADPCM formats.
    QSV and NVenc now support AV1 encoding. The FFmpeg CLI (we usually reffer to it as ffmpeg.c
    to avoid confusion) has speed-up improvements due to threading, as well as statistics options,
    and the ability to pass option values for filters from a file. There are quite a few new audio
    and video filters, such as adrc, showcwt, backgroundkey and ssim360, with a few hardware ones too.
    Finally, the release features many behind-the-scenes changes, including a new FFT and MDCT
    implementation used in codecs (expect a blog post about this soon), numerous bugfixes, better
    ICC profile handling and colorspace signalling improvement, introduction of a number of RISC-V
    vector and scalar assembly optimized routines, and a few new improved APIs, which can be viewed
    in the doc/APIchanges file in our tree.
    A few submitted features, such as the Vulkan improvements and more FFT optimizations will be in the
    next minor release, 6.1, which we plan to release soon, in line with our new release schedule.
    Some highlights are:

    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to
    upgrade unless they use current git master.

    underwent to remove the old encode/decode APIs and replace them with an
    N:M-based API, the entire libavresample library was removed, libswscale
    has a new, easier to use AVframe-based API, the Vulkan code was much improved,
    many new filters were added, including libplacebo integration, and finally,
    DoVi support was added, including tonemapping and remuxing. The default
    AAC encoder settings were also changed to improve quality.

    This has been a long time coming but we wanted to give a proper closure to our participation in this run of the program and it takes time. Sometimes it's just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.
  ,
    Without further ado, here's the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:
  ,
    Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav's work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.
  ,
    Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.
  ,
    Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair's work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.
  ,
    Ján Sebechlebský's generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so Ján spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.
  ,
    Jai Luthra's objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai's code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder's speed and efficiency.
  ,
    Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There's still work to be done to call these filters 'finished', which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.
  ,
    And that's it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!

    Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of
    January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device
    has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output
    devices have been updated to support SDL2.
  ,
    ,, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It fixes several bugs.
  ,
    We recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  ,
    After thorough deliberation, we're announcing that we're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release.
    ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat
    library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has
    been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.
    Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs
    and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.
  ,
    ,, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It mainly deals with a few ABI issues introduced in the previous release.
  ,
    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, especially those who experienced issues upgrading from 3.0, to
    upgrade unless they use current git master.

    We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and
    libaacplus in FFmpeg master.
  ,
    Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as
    ,, it was known that libvo-aacenc
    was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.
    However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open
    Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option
    in our code base.
  ,
    When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding
    High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported
    by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.
  ,
    The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by
    Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC
    encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer
    FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth
    supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the
    most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.
  ,
    Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and
    libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition
    to the native encoder (,) when updating to the next version
    of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder
    name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC
    (,) with an appropriate , option
    to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you
    will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing
    headaches.
  ,
    Enjoy!
  ,
    We have made several new point releases (,).
    They fix various bugs, as well as CVE-2016-1897 and CVE-2016-1898.
    Please see the changelog for each release for more details.
  ,
    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use
    current git master.
  ,
    After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag
    removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent
    at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme
    cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater
    quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.
  ,
    Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the
    encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with
    support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly
    free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those
    who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.
  ,
    The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started
    during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.
    Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer
    and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks
    to , who does comparisons
    and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the
    encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide
    feedback or breakage reports through our ,.

    Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of
    each single project.
  ,
    Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to
    implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the
    already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.
  ,
    The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting
    a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and
    partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now
    possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:
  ,
    The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept
    several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not
    have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part
    was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
    Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
    the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded
    content.
  ,
    The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to
    make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement
    real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By
    the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code
    review.
  ,
    Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented
    Samba directory listing as qualification task.
  ,
    During the program he extended the API with the possibility to
    remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the
    implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP
    protocols.
  ,
    At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an
    implementation for HTTP directory listening.
  ,
    Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He
    got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.
  ,
    The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the
    ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.
  ,
    The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the
    ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to
    finally figure out how to get DVB working.
  ,
    Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text
    subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and
    is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported
    by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.
  ,
    ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all
    formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.
  ,
    Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for
    text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like
    bold/italics, highlighting, etc.
  ,
    The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very
    different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary
    encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information
    separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track
    which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing
    with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed
    Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into
    separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.
  ,
    Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size
    information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous
    Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.
  ,
    All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.
  ,
    Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.
    To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework
    and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow
    easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.
    The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were
    tried to avoid speed loss.
  ,
    He also added gamma corrected scaling support.
    An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:
  ,
    Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,
    and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to
    FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has
    ended.
  ,
    Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main
    prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only
    TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has
    been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further
    improvements.
  ,
    PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the
    energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and
    the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a
    simple feature.
  ,
    TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding
    artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something
    that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy
    bands).
  ,
    Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by
    exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective
    on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as
    effective on classic X-Y recordings though.
  ,
    Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting
    correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been
    huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,
    and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for
    further improvements to make.
  ,
    In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,
    something he's also working to fix.
  ,
    Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the
    qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via
    various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend
    modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.
  ,
    Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays
    correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder
    produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.
  ,
    During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the
    decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG
    specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the
    PNG decoder has been fixed.
  ,
    For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,
    making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the
    encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.
  ,
    We published release , as new major version.
    It contains all features and bug fixes of the git master branch from September 8th. Please see
    the ,

    Dear multimedia community,
  ,
    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.
  ,
    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
    which have split the community for so long.
  ,
    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
    weeks, and in person at the , in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
    multimedia community.
  ,
    The FFmpeg project.
  , We have received more than 7 offers for hosting and servers, thanks a lot to everyone!,
    After graciously hosting our projects (,, ,
    and ,) for 4 years, Arpi (our hoster) has informed us that we have to secure a new host somewhere else immediately.
  ,
    If you want to host an open source project, please let us know, either on ,
    mailing list or irc.freenode.net #ffmpeg-devel.

    We use about 4TB of storage and at least 4TB of bandwidth / month for various mailing lists, ,, ,, svn, etc.

    files. The workshop is in German language only and prior registration
    is necessary. The workshop will be on Saturday starting at 10 o'clock.

    Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group),
    FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 ""Outreach Program for Women"" intern
    to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014
    (through March 2015).
  ,
    We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are
    countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for
    companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you
    to Samsung and the OPW program committee!
  ,
    If you are thinking on participating in OPW as an intern, please take
    a look at our ,
    for some initial guidelines. The page is still a work in progress, but
    there should be enough information there to get you started. If you, on
    the other hand, are thinking on sponsoring work on FFmpeg through the
    OPW program, please get in touch with us at opw@ffmpeg.org. With your
    help, we might be able to secure some extra intern spots for this round!

    Following our previous post regarding our participation on this year's
    OPW (Outreach Program for Women), we are now reaching out to our users
    (both individuals and companies) to help us gather the needed money to
    secure our spot in the program.,
    We need to put together 6K USD as a minimum but securing more funds would
    help us towards getting more than one intern.,
    You can donate by credit card using
    , and selecting the ""OPW"" option. If you would like to
    donate by money transfer or by check, please get in touch by
    , and we will get back to you

    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
    That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
    Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.

    Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed
    the Libav fork. Many people have requested the packaging of ffmpeg in
    Debian, as it is more feature-complete and in many cases less buggy.

    has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
    system.

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace programs
to export a filesystem to the Linux kernel. The FUSE project consists
of two components: the , kernel module (maintained in the regular
kernel repositories) and the , userspace library (maintained
in this repository). libfuse provides the reference implementation
for communicating with the FUSE kernel module.,A FUSE file system is typically implemented as a standalone
application that links with libfuse. libfuse provides functions to
mount the file system, unmount it, read requests from the kernel, and
send responses back. libfuse offers two APIs: a ""high-level"",
synchronous API, and a ""low-level"" asynchronous API. In both cases,
incoming requests from the kernel are passed to the main program using
callbacks. When using the high-level API, the callbacks may work with
file names and paths instead of inodes, and processing of a request
finishes when the callback function returns. When using the low-level
API, the callbacks must work with inodes and responses must be sent
explicitly using a separate set of API functions.,libfuse is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in
production use across a wide range of systems for many years. However,
at present libfuse does not have any active, regular contributors. The
current maintainer continues to apply pull requests and makes regular
releases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development
beyond addressing high-impact issues. When reporting bugs, please
understand that unless you are including a pull request or are
reporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response. If
you are using libfuse, please consider contributing to the project.,You can download libfuse from
,. To build and install, you
must use , and
,.  After extracting the libfuse
tarball, create a (temporary) build directory and run Meson:,Normally, the default build options will work fine. If you
nevertheless want to adjust them, you can do so with the
, command:,To build, test, and install libfuse, you then use Ninja:,Running the tests requires the ,
Python module. Instead of running the tests as root, the majority of
tests can also be run as a regular user if , is made
setuid root first:,The , program is installed setuid root. This is done to
allow normal users to mount their own filesystem implementations.,To limit the harm that malicious users can do this way, ,
enforces the following limitations:,The user can only mount on a mountpoint for which they have write
permission,The mountpoint must not be a sticky directory which isn't owned by
the user (like /tmp usually is),No other user (including root) can access the contents of the
mounted filesystem (though this can be relaxed by allowing the use
of the , and , mount options in
,),If you intend to use the , mount options, be aware that
FUSE has an unresolved ,: if the
, mount option is not used, the results of the
first permission check performed by the file system for a directory
entry will be re-used for subsequent accesses as long as the inode of
the accessed entry is present in the kernel cache - even if the
permissions have since changed, and even if the subsequent access is
made by a different user. This is of little concern if the filesystem
is accessible only to the mounting user (which has full access to the
filesystem anyway), but becomes a security issue when other users are
allowed to access the filesystem (since they can exploit this to
perform operations on the filesystem that they do not actually have
permissions for).,This bug needs to be fixed in the Linux kernel and has been known
since 2006 but unfortunately no fix has been applied yet. If you
depend on correct permission handling for FUSE file systems, the only
workaround is to use , (which does not currently
support ACLs), or to completely disable caching of directory entry
attributes.,FUSE comes with several example file systems in the ,
directory. For example, the , examples mirror the contents
of the root directory under the mountpoint. Start from there and adapt
the code!,The documentation of the API functions and necessary callbacks is
mostly contained in the files , (for the high-level
API) and , (for the low-level API). An
autogenerated html version of the API is available in the ,
directory and at ,.,If you need help, please ask on the ,
mailing list (subscribe at
,).,Please report any bugs on the GitHub issue tracker at

krb5,"Kerberos: The Network Authentication Protocol,Old news is ,.

    ,The , source release is now
      available.,The , source release is now
      available.,Kerberos is a network authentication protocol.  It is designed to
      provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using
      secret-key cryptography.  A free implementation of this protocol is
      available from the ,.  Kerberos is available in many commercial
      products as well., Many of the protocols
      used in the Internet do not provide any security.  Tools to ""sniff""
      passwords off of the network are in common use by malicious hackers.
      Thus, applications which send an unencrypted password over the
      network are extremely vulnerable.  Worse yet, other client/server
      applications rely on the client program to be ""honest"" about the
      identity of the user who is using it.  Other applications rely on the
      client to restrict its activities to those which it is allowed to do,
      with no other enforcement by the server.,Some sites attempt to use , to
      solve their network security problems.  Unfortunately, firewalls
      assume that ""the bad guys"" are on the outside, which is often a very
      bad assumption.  Most of the really damaging incidents of computer
      crime are carried out by insiders.  Firewalls also have a significant
      disadvantage in that they restrict how your users can use the
      Internet.  (After all, firewalls are simply a less extreme example of
      the dictum that there is nothing more secure than a computer which is
      not connected to the network --- and powered off!)  In many places,
      these restrictions are simply unrealistic and unacceptable.,Kerberos was created by MIT as a ,.  The Kerberos protocol uses , so that a client can prove its identity to a server
      (and vice versa) across an insecure network connection.  After a
      client and server has used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can
      also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data
      integrity as they go about their business.,Kerberos is freely available from MIT, under copyright
      permissions very similar those used for the BSD operating system
      and the X Window System.  MIT provides Kerberos in source form
      so that anyone who wishes to use it may look over the code for
      themselves and assure themselves that the code is trustworthy.
      In addition, for those who prefer to rely on a professionally
      supported product, Kerberos is available as a product from many
      different vendors.,In summary, Kerberos is a solution to your network security
      problems.  It provides the tools of authentication and strong
      cryptography over the network to help you secure your information
      systems across your entire enterprise.  We hope you find Kerberos as
      useful as it has been to us.  At MIT, Kerberos has been invaluable to
      our Information/Technology architecture.,All images and text on this page are copyright MIT.,MIT Kerberos

which implemented such support.,See ,As said in introduction, this was initially a project of Mozilla to
allow better detection of page encodings, and it used to be part of
Firefox. If not mistaken, this is not the case anymore (probably because
nowadays most websites better announce their encoding, and also UTF-8 is
much more widely spread).,Techniques used by universalchardet are described at https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/intl/universalcharsetdetection,It is to be noted that a lot has changed since the original code, yet
the base concept is still around, basing detection not just on encoding
rules, but importantly on analysis of character statistics in languages.,Original code of , by Mozilla can still be found from the

Starting 2015, I (i.e. Jehan) started contributing, ""standardized""

companies started calling their type engines all things ending in Type:
FreeType, CoolType, ClearType, etc. And then came OpenType, which is the
successor of TrueType. So, for my OpenType implementation, I decided to stick
with the concept but use the Persian translation. Which is fitting given that
Persian is written in the Arabic script, and OpenType is an extension of
TrueType that adds support for complex script rendering, and HarfBuzz is an
implementation of OpenType complex text shaping.,

operations. Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must
run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a
dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices algorithms have been moved
to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and
Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific
closed-source solution.,To address this problem the Linux media community is collaborating with the
industry to develop a camera stack that is open-source-friendly while still
protecting vendor core IP. libcamera was born out of that collaboration and
offers modern camera support to Linux-based systems, including traditional
Linux distributions, ChromeOS and Android.,04 February - ,In recent months, Jacopo has been pushing hard to get the Pine Phone Pro to have

wayland-protocols,"Wayland is a replacement for the X11 window system protocol and
architecture with the aim to be easier to develop, extend, and
maintain.,Wayland is the language (protocol) that applications can use to
talk to a display server in order to make themselves visible and
get input from the user (a person). A Wayland server is called
a ""compositor"". Applications are Wayland clients.,Wayland also refers to a system architecture. It is not just a
server-client relationship between a compositor and applications.
There is no single common Wayland server like Xorg is for X11,
but every graphical environment brings with it one of many compositor
implementations. Window management and the end user experience
are often tied to the compositor rather than swappable components.
,A core part of Wayland architecture is libwayland: an inter-process
communication library that translates a protocol definition in XML to a C
language API. This library does not implement Wayland, it merely
encodes and decodes Wayland messages. The actual implementations are
in the various compositor and application toolkit projects.,Wayland does not restrict where and how it is used. A Wayland
compositor could be a standalone display server running on Linux
kernel modesetting and evdev input devices or on many other
operating systems, or a nested compositor that itself is an X11 or
Wayland application (client). Wayland can even be used in
application-internal communication as is done in some web browsers.
,Part of the Wayland project is also the Weston reference
implementation of a Wayland compositor.  Weston can run as an X client
or under Linux KMS and ships with a few demo clients.  The Weston
compositor is a minimal and fast compositor and is suitable for many
embedded and mobile use cases.  ,Information:,Software:,Development:"

libjxl,"The JPEG XL Image Coding System (ISO/IEC 18181) has a ,  and is particularly optimised for responsive web environments, so that content renders well on a wide range of devices. Moreover, it includes several features that help transition from the legacy JPEG format.,Migrating to JPEG XL reduces storage costs because servers can store a single JPEG XL file to serve both JPEG and JPEG XL clients. Existing JPEG files can be losslessly transcoded to JPEG XL, significantly reducing their size. These can be restored into the exact same JPEG file, ensuring backward compatibility with existing JPEG-based applications. This provides a smooth transition from legacy JPEG platforms to the modern JPEG XL. Both the transcoding and restoration are computationally efficient.,JPEG XL is designed to meet the needs of image delivery on the web and professional photography. It supports wide colour gamut as well as high dynamic range and high bit depth images. JPEG XL further includes features such as animation, alpha channels, layers, thumbnails, lossless and progressive coding to support a , including but not limited to photo galleries, e-commerce, social media, user interfaces and cloud storage. To enable novel applications, it also adds support for 360 degree images, image bursts, large panoramas/mosaics, and printing.,JPEG XL offers significantly better image quality and compression ratios than legacy JPEG, plus a shorter specification. It is designed for computationally efficient encoding and decoding using software implementations without the need for additional hardware acceleration, even on mobile devices.,The codec is designed to allow users to balance three primary criteria for their application:,JPEG XL, like most other JPEG standards, is a multi-part specification. The following parts are currently under development:,Defines the JPEG XL codestream and decoder, which can be used for lossy encoding, lossless encoding, and lossless recompression of existing JPEG images.,Specifies an extensible box-based file format which adds support for metadata (e.g. EXIF and JUMBF) and legacy JPEG bitstream reconstruction data.,Provides test material and procedures to validate proprietary solutions against the standard specification.,Provides a , JPEG XL reference implementation, also available on ,."

essentially never expands the data.  (LZW can double or triple the file size in

Zip is a compression and file packaging/archive utility. Although highly
compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and
with Info-ZIP's own ,, our primary objectives
have been portability and other-than-MSDOS functionality.  Features not
found in the PKWARE version include:

,
,
Plus it's ,, as is the ,.
,.

,
Zip is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution, for
archiving files, and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing
unused files or directories.
Zip puts one or more compressed files into a single ZIP archive,
along with information about the files (name, path, date, time of last
modification, protection, and check information to verify file
integrity). An entire directory structure can be packed into a ZIP
archive with a single command.

,
Zip has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files
without compression.  Zip automatically chooses the better of the two
for each file.  Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.

XSel lets you use the secondary selection, for example:

  Georgian, and Estonian.

,Netpbm is a toolkit for manipulation of graphic images, including
conversion of images between a variety of different formats.  There
are over 300 separate tools in the package including converters for
about 100 graphics formats.  Examples of the sort of image
manipulation we're talking about are: Shrinking an image by 10%;
Cutting the top half off of an image; Making a mirror image; Creating
a sequence of images that fade from one image to another.

,For details, look at the ,.

,The package is intended to be portable to many platforms. It has, at
least at one time, been tested under various Unix-based systems,
Windows, Mac OS X, VMS and Amiga OS.  The maintainer uses and builds
it on a Linux system.

,The goal of Netpbm is to be a single source for all the primitive
graphics utilities, especially converters, one might need.  So if you
know of some freely redistributable software in this vein which is not
in the package yet, you should bring it to the attention of the Netpbm
maintainer so it can be included in the next release.

,Netpbm does not contain interactive tools and doesn't have a graphical
interface.  The programs are useful invoked from a typed shell command, but
most are also oriented toward being used internally by a program.


,See ,.


,Instructions for building and installing Netpbm are in the Netpbm
source tree in file ,.


,There is no mailing list or tracking system for bug reports and
requests for help.  Just send an email to the maintainer, Bryan
Henderson, at ,.
Bryan responds fairly quickly and reliably.

,Please check the , for your
release series first to see if the bug has already been fixed.  The
, option on most Netpbm programs tells you which
release you are using.

,There is no bug tracking system because there aren't enough bug
reports to make it worthwhile.  The maintainer responds to each
emailed bug report immediately.

,Note that there is generally no such thing as a bug that has been
reported but does , have a fix listed in the change history.
That's because when a bug is reported, there is a new release within a
few days to fix it (or a documentation change making it not a bug).

,Netpbm is maintained and distributed via a
,.

,

,See , for a quick list of Debian packages
  you can install and then probably be able to build Netpbm from source (which
  you're likely to need to do because Debian doesn't have a reasonable Netpbm
  package).

,If you have trouble getting, building, or installing the
prerequisites, the Netpbm maintainer wants to know.  Since he uses
them himself, he can help you.  And if there is a problem with a
prerequisite package that its own maintainer cannot fix, it may be
possible to ship a fix with Netpbm.

,To build and install Netpbm, you need GNU Make and a Perl
interpreter.  You can get GNU Make from , and Perl from
,.  You need the basic Perl interpreter
and the core modules (warning: these are separate packages on Fedora).  It's
possible to get around the Perl requirement by running some of the steps on a
different machine that has Perl and doing others manually.  There is no
practical substitute for GNU Make.

,The Netpbm package as a whole uses over half a dozen external
libraries, but you don't necessarily need to install them all in order
to build Netpbm.  Each library is used by a few Netpbm programs, and
if you don't have the library, the Netpbm build will automatically
skip building those parts.  See the ,.

, (the Postscript to PNM image converter)
requires , (installed with
the name , in your command search path).  And it requires in
particular that Ghostscript be built with the relevant PNM device drivers.

,Any C compiler that implements the C89 standard (which means probably any C
compiler you will encounter) should work.  However,
, is broken in a way that makes it unable to
compile Netpbm.  Any other version of GCC or Clang should work.

,Netpbm requires a C runtime library (libc) that implements Single Unix
Specification, version 2 (ca. 1997).  Some compilers or C runtime libraries,
including MinGW, incorrectly implement feature test macros and either the
library header files or Netpbm must be slightly modified for the code to
compile.  The GNU C library at Version 2 or higher should work, which includes
any Linux distribution you're likely to encounter.

,Netpbm requires about 9 MiB of disk space, not including documentation.
The documentation is 4 MiB, but you don't necessarily have to install
it; you can just access the public copy.

,The following command on a Debian 10 system should get you everything
  you need to get, build, and install Netpbm from source:

  ,Netpbm consists of code contributed by many authors and most of them,
or in some cases their employers, have copyright in the parts they wrote All
authors have granted you the right to use and distribute their code without
having to pay them, as long as you meet some simple requirements.  All of
these public licenses are ""open source"" licenses as defined by
SourceForge (SourceForge makes that a condition of distributing the code).

,You can generally find an offer of a copyright license within the source
code files.  GPL, BSD, MIT, and BSD licenses are among those offered.  Steve
McIntyre did a survey of the source code in 2001 for the purpose of
determining what could be included in Debian and summarized what he found in
the file
,
in the source tree.

,Of course, with Netpbm as with most open source software, you can't be sure
who wrote the code or if the license offers you find are actually from the
people who hold the copyright.  Someone at some time may have copied code
without permission and contributed it to Netpbm, which means if you copy it
further, you could owe the copyright owner royalties.  However, the risk of
this should be small because no contributions to Netpbm are valuable enough
that such a copyright owner would bother enforcing the copyright.

,The Netpbm maintainer has not received any warranties that the code is
licensed and does not offer any such warranties to anyone else.

,There could be patents practiced by Netpbm code, which would make a user of
the code liable for royalties to the patent holder.  The Netpbm maintainer has
no license to use any patents.  There are no active patents known to the
Netpbm maintainer covering Netpbm, but there used to be, detailed in the file
,
in the source tree.


,Many people use Netpbm to perform graphics functions in a web site.  They
have CGI scripts that invoke Netpbm programs to process images for display
on a web page.  Gallery and 4Images are two web site software packages
that rely on Netpbm for graphics manipulation.

,Installing Netpbm requires different skills and system access than 
installing most other web site software.  You must be able to compile
C code for the web server machine and have a basic understanding of 
how files are organized and programs run on the web server.  Diagnosing
inevitable problems usually requires shell access to the web server.

,Netpbm is basic graphics software that ought to be supplied by any
web hosting service.  If it isn't on your web server already, you should
request that the system administrator add it.


,Netpbm's popularity is mostly historical.  There was a time when it was the
premier graphics processing package in the world, but that was a time when
computers were mainly used by engineers and scientists - people who were
comfortable typing shell commands and writing programs.  It was a time when
graphical user interfaces were weak and rare.  Today, a few of Netpbm's 300+
programs are quite popular, but most of them are used mainly by very old
programs and even older programmers.  A person is more likely to crop a
picture today using Adobe Photoshop or Gimp than Netpbm's , or
convert from GIF to PNG with ImageMagick.

,Another reason for declining popularity is that Netpbm's main feature when
it was new was its ability to convert among graphics formats.  All but eight
of the 100 formats Netpbm knows are seen only in museums today.

,None of this means Netpbm is obsolete.  Among the niche of engineers who
appreciate modular design, code reuse, and building things from building
blocks, Netpbm has no equal.  These people continue to use it in large
numbers, and there are new releases, usually containing new features, every
three months.

,In June 2012, Netpbm developer and user Akira F Urushibata did a study of
The Linux-based operating system Fedora and found that 114 Netpbm programs
were used to some extent in at least one Fedora package.  This included
converters for 34 graphics formats.

,The ten most popular (by count of packages using it) Netpbm programs in
Fedora were, in order from the most popular:

,The ten most popular not counting converters were:

,It's worth noting that the actual package dependencies show far less use of
Netpbm than these numbers indicate.  This study was done by searching for
names of Netpbm programs in the packages' files.

,Download counts are not possible because Netpbm distributes mainly through
Subversion checkout.


, stretches back to 1988.
Briefly: Netpbm replaces the widely spread Pbmplus package (last
released December 10, 1991).  Myriad improvements and additions have
been made.  After the latest release of Pbmplus, a lot of additional
filters began circulating on the net, which was a fairly novel state
of affairs at the time.  The aim of Netpbm was to collect these and to
turn them into a package, hence the name ""Netpbm.""  This work has been
performed by programmers all over the world.

,For detailed code change history, see ,.  From here, you can tell if a
certain bug has been fixed since the release in which you see it, and
what new features are in newer releases than what you have.

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to interface
with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.
HIDAPI can be either built as a shared library (,, , or ,) or
can be embedded directly into a target application by adding a ,
file (per platform) and a single header.,
See , on embedding , into your build system.,HIDAPI library was originally developed by Alan Ott (,).,It was moved to , on June 4th, 2019, in order to merge important bugfixes and continue development of the library.,On Linux, either the hidraw or the libusb back-end can be used. There are
tradeoffs, and the functionality supported is slightly different. Both are
built by default. It is up to the application linking to hidapi to choose
the backend at link time by linking to either , or
,.,Note that you will need to install an udev rule file with your application
for unprivileged users to be able to access HID devices with hidapi. Refer
to the , file in the , directory
for an example.,This back-end uses the hidraw interface in the Linux kernel, and supports
both USB and Bluetooth HID devices. It requires kernel version at least 2.6.39
to build. In addition, it will only communicate with devices which have hidraw
nodes associated with them.
Keyboards, mice, and some other devices which are blacklisted from having
hidraw nodes will not work. Fortunately, for nearly all the uses of hidraw,
this is not a problem.,This back-end uses libusb-1.0 to communicate directly to a USB device. This
back-end will of course not work with Bluetooth devices.,HIDAPI also comes with a Test GUI. The Test GUI is cross-platform and uses
Fox Toolkit ,.  It will build on every platform
which HIDAPI supports.  Since it relies on a 3rd party library, building it
is optional but it is useful when debugging hardware.,NOTE: Test GUI based on Fox Toolkit is not actively developed nor supported
by HIDAPI team. It is kept as a historical artifact. It may even work sometime
or on some platforms, but it is not going to get any new features or bugfixes.,Instructions for installing Fox-Toolkit on each platform is not provided.
Make sure to use Fox-Toolkit v1.6 if you choose to use it.,If you want to play around with your HID device before starting
any development with HIDAPI and using a GUI app is not an option for you, you may try ,.,This app has a console interface for most of the features supported
by HIDAPI library.,The API provides the most commonly used HID functions including sending
and receiving of input, output, and feature reports. The sample program,
which communicates with a heavily hacked up version of the Microchip USB
Generic HID sample looks like this (with error checking removed for
simplicity):,You can also use ,
as a starting point for your applications.,HIDAPI may be used by one of three licenses as outlined in ,.,If you want to build your own application that uses HID devices with HIDAPI,
you need to get HIDAPI development package.,Depending on what your development environment is, HIDAPI likely to be provided
by your package manager.,For instance on Ubuntu, HIDAPI is available via APT:,HIDAPI package name for other systems/package managers may differ.

,The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform independent, interface
to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism.  The libseccomp API is
designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based syscall filter language and
present a more conventional function-call based filtering interface that should
be familiar to, and easily adopted by, application developers.,The library source repository currently lives on GitHub at the following URL:,The Go language bindings repository currently lives on GitHub at the following
URL:,The libseccomp library currently supports the architectures listed below:,The ""doc/"" directory contains all of the currently available documentation,
mostly in the form of manpages.  The top level directory also contains a README
file (this file) as well as the LICENSE, CREDITS, CONTRIBUTING, and
CHANGELOG files.,Those who are interested in contributing to the project are encouraged to
read the CONTRIBUTING in the top level directory.,Before use you should verify the downloaded release tarballs and checksums
using the detached signatures supplied as part of the release; the detached
signature files are the ""*.asc"" files.  If you have GnuPG installed you can
verify detached signatures using the following command:,At present, only the following keys, specified via the fingerprints below, are
authorized to sign official libseccomp releases:,More information on GnuPG can be found at their website, ,.,If you are building the libseccomp library from an official release tarball,
you should follow the familiar three step process used by most autotools based
applications:,However, if you are building the library from sources retrieved from the source
repository you may need to run the autogen.sh script before running configure.
In both cases, running ""./configure -h"" will display a list of build-time
configuration options.,There are a number of tests located in the ""tests/"" directory and a make target
which can be used to help automate their execution.  If you want to run the
standard regression tests you can execute the following after building the
library:,These tests can be safely run on any Linux system, even those where the kernel
does not support seccomp-bpf (seccomp mode 2).  However, be warned that the
test run can take a while to run and produces a lot of output.,The generated seccomp-bpf filters can be tested on a live system using the
""live"" tests; they can be executed using the following commands:,These tests will fail if the running Linux Kernel does not provide the
necessary support.,The ""tools/"" directory includes a number of tools which may be helpful in the
development of the library, or applications using the library.  Not all of
these tools are installed by default.,Problems with the libseccomp library can be reported using the GitHub issue
tracking system.  Those who wish to privately report potential vulnerabilities
should follow the directions in SECURITY.md.,

gsm," and EFR,use,sox,had,
The low-level speech compression algorithm of the GSM suite is
called , (Regular-Pulse Excitation
	Long-Term Predictor).
	My colleague Dr. Carsten Bormann and I have implemented a GSM 06.10
	RPE-LTP coder and decoder in C.,
Its , is , available, and we
encourage you to use it,
play with it, and invent new real-time media protocols and algorithms.
,
Our implementation consists of a C library and a stand-alone program.
Both are destined to be compiled and used on a Unix-like environment
with at least 32-bit-integers, but others have ported it to VMS and a
MS-DOS 16-bit-environment. 
GSM 06.10 is faster than code-book lookup algorithms such as CELP,
but by no means cheap; to use it for real-time communication,
you will need at least a medium-scale workstation.
(That's what we wrote back in 1994.
Nowadays, your cellphone probably has a GSM 06.10 codec built-in
and is barely breaking a sweat.) 
,
When using the ,, you create a , object that holds the state
necessary to either encode frames of 160 16-bit PCM samples into 264-bit
GSM frames, or to decode GSM frames into linear PCM frames.
If you want to examine and change the individual parts of the GSM frame,
you can ``explode'' it into an array of 70 parameters, change them there,
and ``implode'' them back into a packed frame; you can also print a
whole GSM frame to a file in human-readable format with a single function call.
,
Our library client, called ,, is modeled after
the Unix , program.
Running , will
compress the file myspeech, remove it, and collect the result of
the compression in a new file called ,, while , will reverse the process. The big difference
between toast and compress is that toast loses information with each
compression cycle. (After a few iterations, you can
hear high-pitched ,
that I initially mistook for birds outside of my office window.)


,
In any case, that was more than 30 years ago; given that 20 years is a common
duration of patent protection, I don't think any of it applies today.
,
The other new thing is that we've added long-overdue , support
to ,.
This coincided with a move to a slightly different flavor of web hosting
for the entire site; let me know if I broke something else.
The hosting changed, but the site is still the same.
,
(Update 2022-08-19-- 
Yes, turns out I did break something else, including, possibly,
the MIME type of the downloaded archive and the fact that the link
to the archive was in http:, but came from an https: site; something
that Google Chrome does not take to kindly and straight out interprets
as a sign of an attack rather than simply incompetence. Humpfh.)
,
As some people have noticed with release 1.0-pl20, I've still not quite gotten the hang of not changing a patchlevel release after releasing it.
Anyway, the current checksum is ...
,
Nobody seems to , A-law much, so it is conceivable that
the wrong tables might have gone undetected since 1992.  The
new tables have been independently tested against the vectors
supplied with G.726, and match those the ITU, Bell Labs, and at
least one other implementor use.
,
If you don't care about the math test, you don't have to
change the types.  In spite of the failing test, the library
does work fine even with a 64-bit ,.  (It's been
tested against byte-swapped ETSI test patterns.)

,
After fretting over intellectual property rights for
a few months,
Microsoft has now registered the encoding inside the WAV chunk as a 
MIME type, particularly for use in the context of VPIM (Voice Profile
for Interenet Mail)'s spinoff IVM, a way of sending
Voice Messages as MIME documents.
,
The Microsoft ietf-draft is avalable as
,
from IETF draft repositories.
,
Long before that, Jeff Chilton
figured out the format with trial-and-error when he needed to write
compressed wave files for his short,wave radio application.
,
The patchlevel 9 release of GSM integrates Jeff's ``unofficial''
, in slightly different form,
breaking his sample source code along the way.
The , 
has its GSM_OPT_WAV_FMT changed to GSM_OPT_WAV49, and (thanks
to Dima Barsky) a more portable way of looking at fputs's
result.  If you couldn't get it to work earlier on a SysV-ish
environment, try again.

,

,
	(Update: Pierre Larbier reports that the final ETSI
	release of the GSM 06.10 test sequences, attached to
	ETS 300 580-2 edition 2 (GSM 06.10 version 4.1.1),
	has corrected its SEQ01 to produce
	only the promised 49 overflows.)

I studied computer science at many years ago.
I don't know whether my alma mater is suffering some sort of technical
failure, or whether they finally noticed that I've been gone for about
ten years - but my directories there don't seem to exist anymore.
I made a couple of backups over the years, but I'll take the opportunity
to trim down the page a little.

Chris Edwards did a Java port of the GSM 06.10 Encoder.
,
An open-source applet that can play lots of different GSM variants (with or without
.wav header) is ,,
from voxeo's Omi Chandiramani.  It's being extended to play other sound formats,
too, and you can help.

,
Richard Elofsson <rel@ldecs.ericsson.se> has made the
his DOS-port of the Patchlevel 4 release
available. (He fixed bugs that it took me until 
Patchlevel 7 to find, though.) 
The source code, which compiles with Turbo C++ version 1.01,
could once be found as dos.zip in the toplevel GSM ftp directory.
  Back when FTP was still a thing.
,
Sergey A. Zhatchenko (,),
from Novosibirsk, Russia, has donated a ,, derived from a patchlevel 6 release of the GSM
library.,Make sure your input filenames have no suffix;
this version of toast doesn't know that MS-DOS doesn't like more
than one dot in its filenames.

,

,
,
(Of course, this says very little about what will be possible
in non-DSP software.)
,
In the proceedings of the September's EUROSPEECH'95 in Madrid,
Tim Fingscheidt, T. Wiechers and E. Delfs have published a
paper on ``Implementation Aspects of the GSM Half-Rate Speech Codec''
(pp. 723/726). Tim, whose group implemented a half-rate
codec for the NEC ,PD77018 based on the 06.06 source code,
estimates the complexity of the half-rate codec at 4-6 times that of
the full-rate version.


,
At the moment, it doesn't seem as if we're going to implement
GSM 06.06 here.
,
The test patterns for GSM 06.06, GSM 06.07, will become
draft ETS 300 581-8, and lag the source code by about two
weeks. 
06.42 is half-rate voice activity detection, 06.22 comfort noise.

The syntax of
color codes is,where XXX is a hex number. The first digit of the number represents
the red component of the color, the second digit represents green and
the third blue (good ol' RGB). See below for an example of use of
color codes:,This can become a bit tedious after a while, so there are (only some
for now) human readable color codes provided:,As you can see above, if a colored shape contains any text, the color
of the text is adjusted according to the underlying color. If the
underlying color is dark, the text color is changed to white (from the
default black).,Note that color codes only apply if they are within closed shapes, and
they have no effect anywhere outside., recognises some tags that change the way a rectangular shape is rendered. All tags are between , and ,. See the reference below:,Document - Symbol representing a document.,Storage - Symbol representing a form of storage, like a database or a hard disk.,Input/Output - Symbol representing input/output.,Ellipse,Manual operation,Decision (""Choice""),Trapezoid,Any lines that contain either at least one , (for horizontal lines)
or at least one , (for vertical lines) are rendered as dashed
lines. Only one of those characters can make a whole line dashed, so
this feature ""spreads"". The rationale behind that is that you only
have to change one character to switch from normal to dashed (and vice
versa), rather than redrawing the whole line/shape. Special symbols
(like document or storage symbols) can also be dashed. See below:,If , is encountered on a line (but not at the end of the line), it
is rendered as a special marker, called the point marker (this feature
is still experimental). See below:,If the pattern ' o XXXXX' is encountered, where XXXXX is any text, the
'o' is interpreted and rendered as a bullet point. Note that there
must be a space before the 'o' as well as after it. See below:,When , is run using the , option, the input is an HTML
file. The contents of the , tags are rendered
as diagrams and saved in the images directory and a new HTML file is
produced with the appropriate , tags.,If the id parameter is present in the , tag, its value is used as
the filename of the rendered png. Otherwise a filename of the form
, is used, where X is a number. Similarly, if there
is no output filename specified, the converted html file is named in
the form of ,, where , is the filename of the
original file.,In this mode, files that exist are not generated again, they are just
skipped. You can force overwrite of the files using the ,

    , Python !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*, !=3.4.*, !=3.5.*, !=3.6.*, >=2.7
  ,Makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing colored terminal text and
cursor positioning) work under MS Windows., |
, |
,If you find Colorama useful, please , to the authors. Thank you!,Tested on CPython 2.7, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 and Pypy 2.7 and 3.8.,No requirements other than the standard library.,ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminal
text and cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on
Windows, too, by wrapping ,, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which
would appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the
appropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms,
Colorama does nothing.,This has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing
colored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing
applications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on
Linux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling
, (since v0.4.6) or ,
(all versions, but may have other side-effects – see below).,An alternative approach is to install , on Windows machines, which
provides the same behaviour for all applications running in terminals. Colorama
is intended for situations where that isn’t easy (e.g., maybe your app doesn’t
have an installer.),Demo scripts in the source code repository print some colored text using
ANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal’s built in ANSI
handling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:,These screenshots show that, on Windows, Colorama does not support ANSI ‘dim
text’; it looks the same as ‘normal text’.,If the only thing you want from Colorama is to get ANSI escapes to work on
Windows, then run:,If you’re on a recent version of Windows 10 or better, and your stdout/stderr
are pointing to a Windows console, then this will flip the magic configuration
switch to enable Windows’ built-in ANSI support.,If you’re on an older version of Windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing to
a Windows console, then this will wrap , and/or , in a
magic file object that intercepts ANSI escape sequences and issues the
appropriate Win32 calls to emulate them.,In all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever. Basically the idea is
that this makes Windows act like Unix with respect to ANSI escape handling.,It’s safe to call this function multiple times. It’s safe to call this function
on non-Windows platforms, but it won’t do anything. It’s safe to call this
function when one or both of your stdout/stderr are redirected to a file – it
won’t do anything to those streams.,Alternatively, you can use the older interface with more features (but also more
potential footguns):,This does the same thing as ,, except for the
following differences:,It’s not safe to call , multiple times; you can end up with multiple
layers of wrapping and broken ANSI support.,Colorama will apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ANSI,
and if it thinks they don’t, then it will wrap , and
, in a magic file object that strips out ANSI escape sequences
before printing them. This happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if
you want to write your code to emit ANSI escape sequences unconditionally, and
let Colorama decide whether they should actually be output. But note that
Colorama’s heuristic is not particularly clever., also accepts explicit keyword args to enable/disable various
functionality – see below.,To stop using Colorama before your program exits, simply call ,.
This will restore , and , to their original values, so that
Colorama is disabled. To resume using Colorama again, call ,; it is
cheaper than calling , again (but does the same thing).,Most users should depend on ,, and use
,. The old , interface will be supported
indefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don’t plan to fix any issues
with it, also for backwards compatibility.,Cross-platform printing of colored text can then be done using Colorama’s
constant shorthand for ANSI escape sequences. These are deliberately
rudimentary, see below.,…or simply by manually printing ANSI sequences from your own code:,…or, Colorama can be used in conjunction with existing ANSI libraries
such as the venerable ,
the fabulous ,,
or the incredible ,.,If you wish Colorama’s Fore, Back and Style constants were more capable,
then consider using one of the above highly capable libraries to generate
colors, etc, and use Colorama just for its primary purpose: to convert
those ANSI sequences to also work on Windows:,SIMILARLY, do not send PRs adding the generation of new ANSI types to Colorama.
We are only interested in converting ANSI codes to win32 API calls, not
shortcuts like the above to generate ANSI characters.,Available formatting constants are:, resets foreground, background, and brightness. Colorama will
perform this reset automatically on program exit.,These are fairly well supported, but not part of the standard:,ANSI codes to reposition the cursor are supported. See , for
an example of how to generate them., accepts some , to override default behaviour.,If you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color
changes at the end of every print, then , will
automate that:,Pass , or , to override whether ANSI codes should be
stripped from the output. The default behaviour is to strip if on Windows
or if output is redirected (not a tty).,Pass , or , to override whether to convert ANSI codes in the
output into win32 calls. The default behaviour is to convert if on Windows
and output is to a tty (terminal).,On Windows, Colorama works by replacing , and ,
with proxy objects, which override the , method to do their work.
If this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by passing
,. The default behaviour is to wrap if , or
, or , are True.,When wrapping is disabled, colored printing on non-Windows platforms will
continue to work as normal. To do cross-platform colored output, you can
use Colorama’s , proxy directly:,ANSI sequences generally take the form:,Where , is an integer, and , is a single letter. Zero or
more params are passed to a ,. If no params are passed, it is
generally synonymous with passing a single zero. No spaces exist in the
sequence; they have been inserted here simply to read more easily.,The only ANSI sequences that Colorama converts into win32 calls are:,Multiple numeric params to the , command can be combined into a single
sequence:,All other ANSI sequences of the form ,
are silently stripped from the output on Windows.,Any other form of ANSI sequence, such as single-character codes or alternative
initial characters, are not recognised or stripped. It would be cool to add
them though. Let me know if it would be useful for you, via the Issues on
GitHub.,I’ve personally only tested it on Windows XP (CMD, Console2), Ubuntu
(gnome-terminal, xterm), and OS X.,Some valid ANSI sequences aren’t recognised.,If you’re hacking on the code, see ,. ESPECIALLY, see the
explanation there of why we do not want PRs that allow Colorama to generate new
types of ANSI codes.,See outstanding issues and wish-list:

GNU Libidn is a fully documented implementation of the Stringprep,
Punycode and IDNA 2003 specifications.  Libidn's purpose is to encode and
decode internationalized domain names.  The native C, C# and Java
libraries are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 2.1 or later.
,
The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation.  Profiles
for Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL, XMPP and Kerberos V5 are included.
Punycode and ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported.
A mechanism to define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation
tables, and to compare strings against those tables, is included.
Default tables for some TLDs are also included.
,
The Stringprep API consists of two main functions, one for converting
data from the system's native representation into UTF-8, and one
function to perform the Stringprep processing.  Adding a new
Stringprep profile for your application within the API is
straightforward.  The Punycode API consists of one encoding function
and one decoding function.  The IDNA API consists of the ToASCII and
ToUnicode functions, as well as an high-level interface for converting
entire domain names to and from the ACE encoded form.  The TLD API
consists of one set of functions to extract the TLD name from a domain
string, one set of functions to locate the proper TLD table to use
based on the TLD name, and core functions to validate a string against
a TLD table, and some utility wrappers to perform all the steps in one
call.
,
The library is used by, e.g., GNU SASL and Shishi to process user
names and passwords.  Libidn can be built into GNU Libc to enable a
new system-wide getaddrinfo flag for IDN processing.
,
Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20 Unix
platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows.  The
library is written in C and (parts of) the API is also accessible from
C++, Emacs Lisp, Python and Java.  A native Java and C# port is
included.
,
Also included is a command line tool, several self tests, code
examples, and more, all licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 3.0 or later.

hwloc primarily aims at helping

For instance, two tasks that tightly cooperate

However, two independent memory-intensive tasks should better be spread out
onto different sockets so as to maximize their memory throughput.
As described in ,,

for testing your software on architectures you don't have access to.
, hwloc may display the topology in multiple convenient formats (see

It also offers a powerful programming interface to gather information
about the hardware, bind processes, and much more.,Since it uses standard Operating System information, hwloc's support is
almost always independent from the processor type (x86, powerpc, ia64, ...),
and just relies on the Operating System support. Whenever the OS does not

 It then shows how hwloc may be used by MPI implementations and OpenMP
 runtime systems as a way to carefully place processes and adapt communication
 strategies to the underlying hardware.
,
 For citing how hwloc deals with new heterogeneous memory hierarchies
 (Knights Landing's MCDRAM, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), non-volatile memory (NVDIMM), etc),
 use this paper:
,
 When discussing the overhead of topology discovery and why XML or synthetic topologies are useful, use this paper:
,
 About the memory footprint of hwloc and the new shmem topology API in hwloc 2.0:
,
 For citing hwloc's I/O device locality and cluster/multi-node support, please use the following one instead.
 This paper explains how I/O locality is managed in hwloc, how device details are represented,
 how hwloc interacts with other libraries, and how multiple nodes such as a cluster can be efficiently managed.
,
 For citing hwloc's hierarchical modeling of computing, memory and I/O resources as well as multi-node support,
 use this paper:
,hwloc is the evolution and merger of the libtopology and
, projects.
Because of functional and ideological overlap, these two code bases and ideas
were merged and released under the name ""hwloc"" as an Open MPI sub-project.
hwloc is now mostly developed by the TADaaM team at Inria (Bordeaux, France).
,libtopology was initially developed by the Inria Runtime team-project
as a way to discover hardware affinities inside the Marcel threading library.
With the advent of multicore machines, this work became interesting for much more than multithreading.
So libtopology was extracted from Marcel and became an independent library.
,Portability tests are performed thanks to
the Inria , platform.
, When in doubt, say ""hardware locality."", Some of the core developers say ""H. W. Loke""; others say
""H. W. Lock"".  We've heard several other pronunciations as well.  We
don't really have a strong preference for , you say it; we
chose the name for its Google-ability, not its pronunciation.,  But now at least you know how , pronounce it.  :-)"

qgpgme,"
, (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to
GnuPG easier for applications.  It provides a High-Level Crypto API
for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
management.  Currently it uses GnuPG's OpenPGP backend as the
default, but the API isn't restricted to this engine.  We have, in
fact, already developed a backend for CMS (S/MIME).
,
Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a
complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software
should try to use GPGME instead.  This way bug fixes or improvements
can be done at a central place and every application benefits from
this.  Furthermore, there is no guarentee that any particular
command line option will remain exactly the same at any given point
,
Especially authors of , should consider using GPGME.

pacman,"Pacman Home Page,--sync,--add,--upgrade,A simple library-based package manager.,pacman is a utility which manages software packages in Linux. It uses simple
compressed files as a package format, and maintains a text-based package
database (more of a hierarchy), just in case some hand tweaking is necessary.,pacman does not strive to ""do everything."" It will add, remove and upgrade
packages in the system, and it will allow you to query the package database for
installed packages, files and owners. It also attempts to handle dependencies
automatically and can download packages from a remote server.,Version 2.0 of pacman introduced the ability to sync packages (the ,
option) with a master server through the use of package databases. Prior to
this, packages would have to be installed manually using the , and
, operations.,Version 3.0 was the switch to a two-part pacman — a back-end named libalpm
(library for Arch Linux Package Management) and the familiar pacman front-end.
Speed in many cases was improved, along with dependency and conflict resolution
being able to handle a much wider variety of cases. The switch to a
library-based program should also make it easier in the future to develop
alternative front ends.,Version 4.0 added package signing and verification capabilities to the entire
makepkg/repo-add/pacman toolchain via GnuPG and GPGME.,Version 5.0 added support for pre/post-transaction hooks and sync database file
list operations.,There are several man pages available for the programs, utilities, and
configuration files dealing with pacman.,

for the syntax rules.,To get started, see the ,, the ,, and the ,.,The Python-Markdown project is developed with the following goals in mind:,Maintain a Python library (with an optional CLI wrapper) suited to use in web
  server environments (never raise an exception, never write to stdout, etc.) as
  an implementation of the markdown parser that follows the
  , and the
  behavior of the original (markdown.pl) implementation as reasonably as
  possible (see , for a few exceptions).,Provide an , which makes it possible
  to change and/or extend the behavior of the parser.,In addition to the basic markdown syntax, Python-Markdown supports the following
features:,Python-Markdown will accept , in any language
supported by Unicode including bi-directional text. In fact the test suite
includes documents written in Russian and Arabic.,Various , are provided (including
,) to change and/or extend the base syntax.
Additionally, a public , is available
to write your own extensions.,Python-Markdown can output documents with either HTML or XHTML style tags.
See the , for details.,In addition to being a Python Library, a
, is available for your convenience.,While Python-Markdown strives to fully implement markdown as described in the
,, the rules
can be interpreted in different ways and different implementations
occasionally vary in their behavior (see the
,
for some examples). Known and intentional differences found in Python-Markdown
are summarized below:,Python-Markdown defaults to ignoring middle-word emphasis (and strong
emphasis). In other words, , will not become
,. This can be switched off if desired. See
the , for details.,The ,
clearly state that when a list item consists of multiple paragraphs, “each
subsequent paragraph in a list item , be indented by either 4 spaces
or one tab” (emphasis added). However, many implementations do not enforce
this rule and allow less than 4 spaces of indentation. The implementers of
Python-Markdown consider it a bug to not enforce this rule.,This applies to any block level elements nested in a list, including
paragraphs, sub-lists, blockquotes, code blocks, etc. They , always
be indented by at least four spaces (or one tab) for each level of nesting.,In the event that one would prefer different behavior,
, can be set to whatever length is
desired. Be warned however, as this will affect indentation for all aspects
of the syntax (including root level code blocks). Alternatively, a 
, may offer a solution that meets your needs.,While the syntax rules are not clear on this, many implementations (including
the original) do not end one list and start a second list when the list marker
(asterisks, pluses, hyphens, and numbers) changes. For consistency,
Python-Markdown maintains the same behavior with no plans to change in the
foreseeable future. That said, the ,
is available to provide a less surprising behavior.,You may report bugs, ask for help, and discuss various other issues on the ,.,

graphene,"Graphene,and,A thin layer of graphic data types,When creating graphic libraries you most likely end up dealing with points
and rectangles. If you're particularly unlucky, you may end up dealing
with affine matrices and 2D transformations. If you're writing a graphic
library with 3D transformations, though, you are going to hit the jackpot:
4x4 matrices, projections, transformations, vectors, and quaternions.,Most of this stuff exists, in various forms, in other libraries, but it
has the major drawback of coming along with the rest of those libraries,
which may or may not be what you want. Those libraries are also available
in various languages, as long as those languages are C++; again, it may or
may not be something you want.,For this reason, I decided to write the thinnest, smallest possible layer
needed to write a canvas library; given its relative size, and the
propensity for graphics libraries to have a pun in their name, I decided
to call it Graphene.,This library provides types and their relative API; it does not deal with
windowing system surfaces, drawing, scene graphs, or input. You're
supposed to do that yourself, in your own canvas implementation, which is
the whole point of writing the library in the first place.,Graphene has minimal dependencies.,Graphene contains optimizations for speeding up vector operations; those
optimizations are optional, and used only if both Graphene was compiled
with support for them , if the system you're running on has them.
Currently, Graphene supports the following platform-specific fast paths:,In the remote case in which none of these optimizations are available,
Graphene will fall back to a naïve scalar implementation.,Graphene can, optionally, provide types for integrating with
,
properties and signals, as well as introspection information for its use
with other languages through introspection-based bindings.,In order to build and install Graphene you will need development tools and
the headers of the dependencies.,Graphene uses the , build system to
generate , build files. You must install
Ninja and Meson before building Graphene.,First of all, clone the Git repository:,Then run:,If you find a bug (which I'm sure there will be plenty), or if you want
to add your own pet feature, then follow these steps:,That's pretty much it.,Please, respect , when writing patches for Graphene.,Graphene provides common types needed to handle 3D transformations:,Graphene also provides its low-level , and , types, which are
used to implement the API above.,All types can be placed on the stack, but provide allocation/free functions
for working on the heap as well. The contents of all structure types, unless
noted otherwise, should be considered private, and should never be accessed

look for their trust anchor certificates in different places, and configuring
each application with a client certificate is a laborious task.,Developers suffer because when an application needs to use security

security configuration, cetrificate/key file locations, security exceptions,
smart cards, and so on. And so progress suffers because there's no foundation

    ,June 16, 2022,This is the latest stable release of the Speex codec
		and the Speex DSP library.,December 7, 2016,This is the latest stable release of the Speex codec library.,January 3, 2015,This brown-paper-bag release adds two headers that should
                   have been included with SpeexDSP 1.2rc2. These are needed
                   to build the resampler with NEON optimizations and to build
                   SpeexDSP without the Speex codec library.
                ,December 6, 2014,This release splits the speex codec library and the speex DSP library
                   into separate source trees. Both projects received build-system
                   improvements, bugfixes, and cleanup. The speex codec's VBR tuning was
                   improved, while the speexdsp resampler got some NEON optimizations.
                ,July 23, 2008,This release adds support for acoustic echo cancellation with multiple 
                microphones and multiple loudspeakers. It also adds an API to decorrelate
                loudspeaker signals to improve multi-channel performance. In the bugfix
                department, there are fixes for a few bugs in the echo canceller, jitter 
                buffer and preprocessor. At this point, the API for 1.2 should be stable
                and only a few very minor additions are planned.,December 11, 2007,The most obvious change in this release is that all the non-codec components (preprocessor,
                echo cancellation, jitter buffer) have been moved to a new , library. 
                Other changes include a new jitter buffer algorithm and resampler improvements/fixes. This is also
                the first release where libspeex can be built without any floating point support. To do this,
                the float compatibility API must be disabled (--disable-float-api or DISABLE_FLOAT_API) and
                the VBR feature must be disabled (--disable-vbr or DISABLE_VBR).,The Xiph , and the Speex Parrot logos are trademarks (™) of Xiph.Org.,These pages © 1994–2006 Xiph.Org. All rights reserved.,Last Modified: ,Validate , and "

using msgpack < 1.0. These options are default from msgpack 1.0 so you can omit them.,Use , for packing and , for unpacking.
msgpack provides , and , as an alias for compatibility with
, and ,., and , packs to a file-like object.
, and , unpacks from a file-like object., unpacks msgpack's array to Python's list, but can also unpack to tuple:,You should always specify the , keyword argument for backward compatibility.
See performance issues relating to ,_ below.,Read the docstring for other options., is a ""streaming unpacker"". It unpacks multiple objects from one
stream (or from bytes provided through its , method).,It is also possible to pack/unpack custom data types. Here is an example for
,.,'s , callback receives a dict; the
, callback may instead be used to receive a list of
key-value pairs.,It is also possible to pack/unpack custom data types using the , type.,As an alternative to iteration, , objects provide ,,
,, , and , methods. The former two
read an entire message from the stream, respectively de-serialising and returning
the result, or ignoring it. The latter two methods return the number of elements
in the upcoming container, so that each element in an array, or key-value pair
in a map, can be unpacked or skipped individually.,Early versions of msgpack didn't distinguish string and binary types.
The type for representing both string and binary types was named ,.,You can pack into and unpack from this old spec using ,
and , options.,To use the , type, pass , object to packer.,You can use it with , and ,. See below.,To unpacking data received from unreliable source, msgpack provides
two security options., (default: ,) limits the internal buffer size.
It is used to limit the preallocated list size too., (default: ,) limits the type of map keys to bytes and str.
While msgpack spec doesn't limit the types of the map keys,
there is a risk of the hashdos.
If you need to support other types for map keys, use ,.,CPython's GC starts when growing allocated object.
This means unpacking may cause useless GC.
You can use , when unpacking large message.,List is the default sequence type of Python.
But tuple is lighter than list.
You can use , while unpacking when performance is important.,

xz,"XZ Utils,minimum,
XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with a high
compression ratio. XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems,
but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems.
XZ Utils are the successor to LZMA Utils.
,
The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on
,, but it has been modified
quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils. The primary compression
algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used inside the .xz container format.
With typical files, XZ Utils create 30 % smaller output than gzip and
15 % smaller output than bzip2.
,
XZ Utils consist of several components:
,
While liblzma has a zlib-like API, liblzma doesn't include any file I/O
functions. A separate I/O library is planned, which would abstract handling
of .gz, .bz2, and .xz files with an easy to use API.
,
The files have been signed with

5.4.2 was released on 2023-03-18.
A minor bug fix release 5.2.11 to the old stable branch
was released on 2023-03-18.

To build without threading support, a workaround is to pass also

This means that if you use a web browser (detected from the user agent),
you will see the Sourceforge download page before the download starts.
The redirection shouldn't affect users of GNU Wget and similar utilities.

A patch to fix a security vulnerability in xzgrep
(CVE-2022-1271, ZDI-CAN-16587) was made public on 2022-04-07.
The patch applies to 4.999.9beta to 5.2.5, 5.3.1alpha, and 5.3.2alpha.
Newer XZ Utils releases include an improved fix for the problem.
,
It is a severe issue if an attacker can control the filenames
that are given on the xzgrep command line.
The vulnerability was discovered by
cleemy desu wayo working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.

Many free software operating systems already provide easy-to-install
XZ Utils binaries.
It doesn't make sense to provide links to all those here.
Instead, binaries or links to websites providing binaries are listed here
only for operating systems that don't have well-known repositories where
users would get software like this.
,
If you have a website that provides up-to-date XZ Utils binaries for
an operating system that meets the the criteria above, let me know
and I will include a link here. Note that I won't host the binaries
themselves without a good reason.
,
The Windows version of XZ Utils includes binaries for 32-bit and 64-bit x86.
The binaries only depend on msvcrt.dll, which is available
on Windows 98 and later out of the box.
,
5.2.10 or 5.2.11 does not have anything significant for Windows so only
5.2.9 is here.
5.4.x builds are not provided for now.

The DOS version of XZ Utils includes only the xz command line tool
and some documentation.
The xz tool should work e.g. on FreeDOS (also in DOSEMU), MS-DOS,
and Windows 95/98/98SE/ME.
This doesn't necessarily work in DOSBox at all,
and at least some problems are expected under Windows XP Command Prompt
(signal handling doesn't work).
,
Since the DOS version is naturally going to get very little testing,
it is recommended to use the Windows version instead of the DOS version
if you need xz under Windows 98 or later.
It is likely that that the DOS version will be updated only occasionally.

5.2.0 and later have experimental support for 8.3 filenames.

The Linux bridge code implements a subset of the ANSI/IEEE 802.1d standard. ,. The original Linux bridging was first done in Linux 2.2, then rewritten by Lennert Buytenhek. The code for bridging has been integrated into 2.4 and 2.6 kernel series.
,
A Linux bridge is more powerful than a pure hardware bridge because it can also filter and shape traffic.  The combination of bridging and firewalling is done with the companion project,.
,
The code is updated as part of the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels available at kernel.org.
,
Possible future enhancements are:
,
Note: ,, instead use the , command from , package.
,
Bridging is supported in the current kernels from all the major distributors. The required administration utilities are in the bridge-utils package in most distributions. All releases are archived at: , , and latest at: ,
,
You can also build your own up to date version by getting the latest kernel from , and build the utilities based from the source code in bridge-utils GIT repository.
,
You need to enable bridging in
 the kernel. Set “networking → 802.1d Ethernet Bridging” to either yes or module
,
Before you start make sure both network cards are set up and working properly. Don't set the IP address, and don't let the startup scripts run DHCP on the ethernet interfaces either. The IP address needs to be set after the bridge has been configured.
,
The command , should show both network cards, and they should be DOWN.
,
In most cases, the bridge code is built as a module. If the module is configured and installed correctly, it will get automatically loaded on the first , command.
,
If your bridge-utilities have been correctly built and your kernel and bridge-module are OK, then issuing a , should show a small command synopsis.
,
The command
,
creates a logical bridge instance with the name ,. You will need at least one logical instance to do any bridging at  all. You can interpret the logical bridge as a container for the interfaces taking part in the bridging. Each bridging instance is represented by a new network interface.
,
The corresponding shutdown command is:
,
The command
,
adds the network device , to take part in the bridging of “bridgename.” All the devices contained in a bridge act as one big network. It is not possible to add a device to multiple bridges or  bridge a bridge device, because it just wouldn't make any sense! The bridge will take a short amount of time when a device is added to learn the Ethernet addresses on the segment before starting to forward.
,
The corresponding command to take an interface out of the bridge is:
,
The , command gives you a summary about the overall bridge status, and the instances running as shown below:
,
Once a bridge is running the , will show information about network addresses of traffic being forwarded (and the bridge itself).
,
The aging time is the number of seconds a MAC address will be kept in the forwarding database after having received a packet from this MAC address. The entries in the forwarding database are periodically timed out to ensure they won't stay around forever. Normally there should be no need to modify this parameter, but it can be changed with (time is in seconds).
,
Setting ageing time to zero makes all entries permanent.
,
If you are running multiple or redundant bridges, then you need to enable the Spanning Tree Protocol (,) to handle multiple hops and avoid cyclic routes.
,
You can see the STP parameters with:
,
There are a number of parameters related to the , that can be configured. The code autodetects the speed of the link and other parameters, so these usually don't need to be changed.
,
Each bridge has a relative priority and cost. Each interface is associated with a port (number) in the STP code. Each has a priority and a cost, that is used to decide which is the shortest path to forward a packet. The lowest cost path is always used unless the other path is down. If you have multiple bridges and interfaces then you may need to adjust the priorities to achieve optimium performance.
,
The bridge with the lowest priority will be elected as the root bridge. The root bridge is the “central” bridge in the spanning tree.
,
Each interface in a bridge could have a different speed and this value is used when deciding which link to use. Faster interfaces should have lower costs.
,
For multiple ports with the same cost there is also a priority
,
Forwarding delay time is the time spent in each of the Listening and Learning states before the Forwarding state is entered. This delay is so that when a new bridge comes onto a busy network it looks at some traffic before participating.
,
Periodically, a hello packet is sent out by the Root Bridge and the Designated Bridges. Hello packets are used to communicate information about the topology throughout the entire Bridged Local Area Network.
,
If a another bridge in the spanning tree does not send out a hello packet for a long period of time, it is assumed to be dead. This timeout is set with:
,
IGMP snooping support is not yet included in bridge-utils or iproute2, but it can be easily controlled through sysfs interface. For brN, the settings can be found under /sys/devices/virtual/net/brN/bridge.
,
This option allows the user to disable IGMP snooping completely. It also allows the user to reenable snooping when it has been automatically disabled due to hash collisions. If the collisions have not been resolved however the system will refuse to reenable snooping.
,
This allows the user to forcibly enable/disable ports as having multicast routers attached. A port with a multicast router will receive all multicast traffic.
,
The value 0 disables it completely. The default is 1 which lets the system automatically detect the presence of routers (currently this is limited to picking up queries), and 2 means that the ports will always receive all multicast traffic.
,
Note: this setting can be enabled/disable on a per-port basis, also through sysfs interface (e.g. if eth0 is some bridge's active port, then you can adjust /sys/…../eth0/brport/multicast_router)
,
These settings allow the user to control the hash elasticity/max parameters. The elasticity setting does not take effect until the next new multicast group is added.  At which point it is checked and if after rehashing it still can't be satisfied then snooping will be disabled.
,
The max setting on the other hand takes effect immediately. It must be a power of two and cannot be set to a value less than the current number of multicast group entries. This is the only way to shrink the multicast hash.
,
These allow the user to control various values related to IGMP snooping.
,
More details about the options, some discussions and rationale can be found in http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/153338
,
The basic setup of a bridge is done like:
,
This will set the host up as a pure bridge, it will not have an IP address for itself, so it can not be remotely accessed (or hacked) via TCP/IP.
,
Optionally you can configure the virtual interface mybridge to take part in your network. It behaves like one interface (like a normal network card). Exactly that way you configure it, replacing the previous command with something like:
,
If you want your bridge to automatically get its IP address from the ADSL modem via DHCP (or a similar configuration), do this:
,
If you do this many times, you may end up with lots of dhclient processes. Either kill them impolitely or learn about ,.
,
In , we first configure two ethernet devices port0 and port1:
,
Then we describe the bridge:
,
Now we can use “ifup mybridge” to bring it up. port0 and port1 will be brought up automatically.
,
A bridge transparently relays traffic between multiple network interfaces. In plain English this means that a bridge connects two or more physical Ethernets together to form one bigger (logical) Ethernet.
,
Yes. The bridge knows nothing about protocols, it only sees Ethernet frames. As such, the bridging functionality is protocol independent, and there should be no trouble relaying IPX, NetBEUI, IP, IPv6, etc.
,
Please note that this code wasn't written with the intent of having Linux boxes take over from dedicated networking hardware. Don't see the Linux bridging code as a replacement for switches, but rather as an extension of the Linux networking capabilities. Just as there are situations where a Linux router is better than a dedicated router (and vice versa), there are situations where a Linux bridge is better than a dedicated bridge (and vice versa).
,
Most of the power of the Linux bridging code lies in its flexibility. There is a whole lot of bizarre stuff you can do with Linux already (read Linux Advanced Routing and Traffic Control document to see some of the possiblities), and the bridging code adds some more filter into the mix.
,
One of the most significant advantages of a Linux solution over a dedicated solution that come to mind is Linux' extensive firewalling capabilities. It is possible to use the full functionality of netfilter (iptables) in combination with bridging, which provides way more functionality than most proprietary offerings do.
,
In order to act a a bridge, the network device must be placed into promiscuous mode which means it receives all traffic on a network. On a really busy network, this can eat significant bandwidth out of the processor, memory slowing the system down. The answer is to setup either a separate dedicated Linux box as the bridge, or use a hardware switch.
,
The performance is limited by the network cards used and the processor. A research paper was done by James Yu at Depaul University comparing Linux bridging with a Catalyst switch,
,
It's not supposed to. The operation of a bridge is (supposed to be) fully transparent to the network, the networks that a bridge connects together are actually to be viewed as one big network. That's why the bridge does not show up in traceroute; the packets do not feel like they are crossing a subnet boundary.
,
For more information on this, read a book about TCP/IP networking.
,
It says: “br_add_bridge: bad address” when I try to add a bridge!
,
Either your kernel is old (2.2 or earlier), or you forgot to configure Ethernet bridging into your kernel.
,
Your kernel might have ethernet filtering (ebtables, bridge-nf, arptables) enabled, and traffic gets filtered. The easiest way to disable this is to go to /proc/sys/net/bridge. Check if the bridge-nf-* entries in there are set to 1; in that case, set them to zero and try again.
,
The base kernel for 2.2, did not support the current bridging code. The original development was on 2.2, and there used to be patches available for it. But these patches are no longer maintained.
,
Yes, work is being done to integrate RSTP support in a future 2.6 release. The code was done for a version of 2.4 and needs to be cleaned up, tested and updated.
,
Linux bridging is very flexible; the ,'s can be either traditional Ethernet device's, or pseudo-devices such as PPP, VPN's or VLAN's. The only restrictions are that the devices:
,
Yes. The code for this is available in most kernels. See ebtables project.
Does it work with ,, ,, or Firewire?
,
No, the addressing and frame sizes are different.
,
It means that your Linux bridge is retransmitting a Topology Change Notification Bridge Protocol Data Unit (so now you know what the letters are for ,. Seriously, there is probably another switch (or Linux bridge) nearby that isn't complying to the rules of the spanning tree protocol (which is what bridges speak).
,
In each bridged local area network, there is one 'master bridge', which is also called the root bridge. You can find out which bridge this is using brctl.
,
When the topology of a bridged local area network changes (f.e. somebody unplugs a cable between two bridges), the bridge which detects this sends a topology change notification to the root bridge. The root bridge will respond to this by setting a 'topology changed' bit in the hello packets it sends out for the next X seconds (X usually being 30). This way, all bridges will learn of the topology change, so that they can take measures like timing out learned MAC entries faster for example.
,
After having sent out a topology change notification, if a bridge does not find the 'topology changed' bit set in the hello packets received (which in essence serves as the 'acknowledgment' of the topology change notification), it concludes that the topology change notification was lost. So it will retransmit it. However, some bridges run lobotomized implementations of the Spanning Tree Protocol which causes them not to acknowledge topology change notifications. If you have one of those bridges as your root bridge, all of the other bridges will keep retransmitting their topology changed notifications. Which will lead to these kinds of syslog messages.
,
There are a number of things you can do:
,
Unfortunately, some network cards have buggy drivers that fail under load. The situation is improving, so having a current kernel and network driver can help. Also try swapping with another brand.
,
Please report all problems to the Bridge mailing list: bridge@osdl.org. If your network card doesn't work (even without bridging) then try the Linux networking mailing list linux-net@vger.kernel.org
,
This is a known problem, and it is not caused by the bridge code. Many wireless cards don't allow spoofing of the source address. It is a firmware restriction with some chipsets. You might find some information in the bridge mailing list archives to help. Has anyone found a way to get around Wavelan not allowing anything but its own MAC address? (answer by Michael Renzmann (mrenzmann at compulan.de))
,
Well, for 99% of computer users there will never be a way to get rid of this. For this function a special firmware is needed. This firmware can be loaded into the RAM of any WaveLAN card, so it could do its job with bridging. But there is no documentation on the interface available to the public. The only way to achieve this is to have a full version of the hcf library which controls every function of the card and also allows accessing the card's RAM. To get this full version Lucent wants to know that it will be a financial win for them, also you have to sign an NDA. So be sure that you won't most probably get access to this peace of software until Lucent does not change its mind in this (which I doubt never will happen).
,
Doing full bridging of wireless (802.11) requires supporting ,. The current implementation doesn't do it.
,
It is possible to do limited wireless to Ethernet functionality with some wireless drivers. This requires the device to be able to support a different sender address and source address. That is what WDS provides.
,
There are ways to make it work, but it is not always straightforward and you probably won't get it right without a pretty solid understanding of 802.11, it's modes, and the frame header format.
,
This is because the network card is getting lots of packets. There are a few things you can try. First, build the driver with NAPI support (if it isn't on by default). NAPI means the driver will do the receive processing at soft IRQ, not at the low level interrupt.
,
If the driver doesn't support NAPI, you can try to increase the amount of work a driver will attempt to do in an interrupt. For 3c59x this is done with the option max_interrupt_work (so add something like 'options 3c59x max_interrupt_work=10000' to your /etc/modules.conf file), other cards might have similar options.
,
The bridge will forward DHCP traffic (broadcasts) and responses. You can also use DHCP to set the local IP address of the bridge pseudo-interface.
,
One common mistake is that the default bridge forwarding delay setting is 30 seconds. This means that for the first 30 seconds after an interface joins a bridge, it won't send anything. This is because if the bridge is being used in a complex topology, it needs to discover other bridges and not create loops. This problem was one of the reasons for the creation of Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP).
,
If the bridge is being used standalone (no other bridges near by). Then it is safe to turn the forwarding delay off (set it to zero), before adding interface to a bridge. Then you can run DHCP client right away.
,

gc,"A garbage collector for C and C++,
The ,-,-,
conservative garbage collector can
be used as a garbage collecting
replacement for C , or C++ ,.
It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would,
without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful.
The collector automatically recycles memory when it determines
that it can no longer be otherwise accessed.
A simple example of such a use is given
,.
,
The collector is also used by a number of programming language
implementations that either use C as intermediate code, want
to facilitate easier interoperation with C libraries, or
just prefer the simple collector interface.
For a more detailed description of the interface, see
,.

Alternatively, the garbage collector  may be used as
a ,

Previously it was best to use corresponding versions of gc

Starting with 8.0, libatomic_ops is only required if the compiler does

Performance of the nonincremental collector is typically competitive
with malloc/free implementations.  Both space and time overhead are
likely to be only slightly higher
for programs written for malloc/free
(see Detlefs, Dosser and Zorn's
,.)
For programs allocating primarily very small objects, the collector
may be faster; for programs allocating primarily large objects it will
be slower.  If the collector is used in a multithreaded environment
and configured for thread-local allocation, it may in some cases
significantly outperform malloc/free allocation in time.
,
We also expect that in many cases any additional overhead
will be more than compensated for by decreased copying etc.
if programs are written
and tuned for garbage collection.

If you are like many computer users, you would frequently like to
make changes in various text files wherever certain patterns appear,
or extract data from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest.
To write a program to do this in a language such as C or Pascal is a
time-consuming inconvenience that may take many lines of code.
The job is easy with awk, especially the GNU implementation: gawk.

,
The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language
that makes it possible to handle simple data-reformatting jobs with
just a few lines of code.

,The source code for the latest release of GNU awk is available from
the GNU project's ,

It includes changes to the X server, to several client libraries, and to the kernel (DRM, Direct Rendering Manager). The most important use for the DRI is to create fast OpenGL implementations providing hardware acceleration for Mesa.

make,"
 ,
 ,
,GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
non-source files of a program from the program's source files. ,Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file
called the ,, which lists each of the non-source files
and how to compute it from other files.  When you write a program, you
should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to
build and install the program.,As a result, if you change a few source files and then run Make, it
does not need to recompile all of your program.  It updates only those
non-source files that depend directly or indirectly on the source
files that you changed. ,A , in the makefile tells Make how to execute a series of
commands in order to build a , file from source files.
It also specifies a list of , of the target file.
This list should include all files (whether source files or other targets)
which are used as inputs to the commands in the rule. ,Here is what a simple rule looks like: ,When you run Make, you can specify particular targets to update;
otherwise, Make updates the first target listed in the makefile.  Of
course, any other target files needed as input for generating these
targets must be updated first. ,Make uses the makefile to figure out which target files ought to be
brought up to date, and then determines which of them actually need to
be updated.  If a target file is newer than all of its dependencies,
then it is already up to date, and it does not need to be regenerated.
The other target files do need to be updated, but in the right order:
each target file must be regenerated before it is used in regenerating
other targets. ,GNU Make has many powerful features for use in makefiles, beyond what
other Make versions have.  It can also regenerate, use, and then delete
intermediate files which need not be saved. ,GNU Make also has a few simple features that are very convenient.  For
example, the , option which says ``pretend that
source file , has not changed, even though it has changed.''
This is extremely useful when you add a new macro to a header file.
Most versions of Make will assume they must therefore recompile all the
source files that use the header file; but GNU Make gives you a way to
avoid the recompilation, in the case where you know your change to the
header file does not require it. ,However, the most important difference between GNU Make and most
versions of Make is that GNU Make is free software. ,We have developed conventions for how to write Makefiles, which all
GNU packages ought to follow.  It is a good idea to follow these
conventions in your program even if you don't intend it to be GNU
software, so that users will be able to build your package just
like many other packages, and will not need to learn anything special
before doing so. ,These conventions are found in the chapter
, of the ,. ,Make

are to be found using (adjusting the path appropriately):,If you want to compile with reduced library linking, configure using:,This library originates in , and has been widely reused without
having a separate release. This package has taken the python bindings
from the , project, and broken it out to a standalone

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again., , ,This is a library that extracts data from stack frames and tracebacks, particularly to display more useful tracebacks than the default. It powers the tracebacks in IPython and ,:,You can install it from PyPI:,Here's some code we'd like to inspect:,Note that , calls a function ,. In reality we can imagine that an exception was raised at this line, or a debugger stopped there, but this is easy to play with directly. Here's a basic implementation:,(Beware that this has a major bug - it doesn't account for line gaps, which we'll learn about later),The output of one call to , looks like:,The code for , is fairly self-explanatory. If you want to learn more details about a particular class or method I suggest looking through some docstrings. , is a class that accepts either a frame or a traceback object and provides a bunch of nice attributes and properties (which are cached so you don't need to worry about performance). In particular , is a list of , objects. , returns the source code of that line suitable for display. Without any arguments it simply strips any common leading indentation. Later on we'll see a more powerful use for it.,You can see that , includes some lines of surrounding context. By default it includes 3 pieces of context before the main line and 1 piece after. We can configure the amount of context by passing options:,Then the output looks like:,Note that these parameters are not the number of , before and after to include, but the number of ,. A piece is a range of one or more lines in a file that should logically be grouped together. A piece contains either a single simple statement or a part of a compound statement (loops, if, try/except, etc) that doesn't contain any other statements. Most pieces are a single line, but a multi-line statement or , condition is a single piece. In the example above, all pieces are one line, because nothing is spread across multiple lines. If we change our code to include some multiline bits:,and then run the original code with the default options, then the output is:,Now lines 8-10 and lines 12-14 are each a single piece. Note that the output is essentially the same as the original in terms of the amount of code. The division of files into pieces means that the edge of the context is intuitive and doesn't crop out parts of statements or expressions. For example, if context was measured in lines instead of pieces, the last line of the above would be , which is much less useful.,However, if a piece is very long, including all of it could be cumbersome. For this, , has a parameter ,, which is 6 by default. Suppose we have a piece in our code that's longer than that:, will truncate this piece so that instead of 7 , objects it will produce 5 , objects and one , in the middle, making 6 objects in total for the piece. Our code doesn't currently handle gaps, so it will raise an exception. We can modify it like so:,Now the output looks like:,Alternatively, you can flip the condition around and check ,. Either way, you should always check for line gaps, or your code may appear to work at first but fail when it encounters a long piece.,Note that the executing piece, i.e. the piece containing the current line being executed (line 15 in this case) is never truncated, no matter how long it is.,The lines of context never stray outside ,, which is the innermost function or class definition containing the current line. For example, this is the output for a short function which has neither 3 lines before nor 1 line after the current line:,Sometimes it's nice to ensure that the function signature is always showing. This can be done with ,. The result looks like this:,To avoid wasting space, pieces never start or end with a blank line, and blank lines between pieces are excluded. So if our code looks like this:,The output doesn't change much, except you can see jumps in the line numbers:,You can also inspect variables and other expressions in a frame, e.g:,which may output:, returns a list of , objects, which have attributes ,, ,, and ,, which is a list of all AST representing that expression.,A , may refer to an expression other than a simple variable name. It can be any expression evaluated by the library , which it deems 'interesting' (see those docs for more info). This includes expressions like , or ,. In these cases , is the source code of that expression. , ensures that it only evaluates expressions that won't have any side effects, e.g. where , is a normal attribute rather than a descriptor such as a property., is a list of all the interesting expressions found in ,, e.g. the current function, which may include expressions not visible in ,. You can restrict the list by using , or even ,. For more control you can use ,. See the docstrings for more information.,Sometimes you may want to insert special characters into the text for display purposes, e.g. HTML or ANSI color codes. , provides a few tools to make this easier.,Let's say we have a , object where , (the original raw source code of that line) is ,, so , is ,, and we want to emphasise that part by inserting HTML at positions 6 and 9 in the text. Here's how we can do that directly:,Here , indicates that the marker is the first of a pair. This helps , sort and insert the markers correctly so you don't end up with malformed HTML like , where tags overlap.,Since we're inserting HTML, we should actually use , which will escape special HTML characters in the Python source (but not the markers) so for example , would be rendered as ,.,Usually though you wouldn't create markers directly yourself. Instead you would start with one or more ranges and then convert them, like so:, has a , attribute which can be any object. , accepts a converter function to which it passes all the , objects. If the converter function returns a pair of strings, it creates two markers from them. Otherwise it should return , to indicate that the range should be ignored, as with the first range containing , in this example.,The reason this is useful is because there are built in tools to create these ranges for you. For example, if we change our , function to contain this:,Then the output becomes:, is a list of RangeInLines for each Variable that appears at least partially in this line. The data attribute of the range is a pair , where node is the particular AST node from the list , that corresponds to this range.,You can also use , (e.g. if you want to do your own syntax highlighting) or , if you want to highlight the currently executing node identified by the , library. Or if you want to make your own range from an AST node, use ,. See the docstrings for more info.,If you'd like pretty colored text without the work, you can let , do it for you. Just follow these steps:,If you want, you can also highlight the executing node in the frame in combination with the pygments syntax highlighting. For this you will need:,Note that this doesn't work with , which just uses the basic ANSI colors and doesn't use the style passed to it in general.,Currently , doesn't actually print the stack, it just prints one frame. Instead of ,, let's do this:,Now the output looks something like this:,However, just as , doesn't always yield , objects, , doesn't always yield , objects, and we must modify our code to handle that. Let's look at some different sample code:,In this code we've forgotten to include a base case in our , function so it will fail with a , and there'll be many frames with similar information. Similar to the built in Python traceback, , avoids showing all of these frames. Instead you will get a , object which summarises the information. See its docstring for more details.,Here is our updated implementation:,And the output:,In addition to handling repeated frames, we've passed a traceback object to , instead of a frame.,If you want, you can pass , to , (not to ,) and it will just yield , objects for the full stack."

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,This intention of this README is to explain how DKMS can be used in conjunction
with tarballs which contain a dkms.conf file within them.,The DKMS project (and any updates) can be found at: ,Installation is performed from the source directory with one of the following
commands:,Distribution specific installations (RPM, DEB, etc.) are not contained in this
source repository.,DKMS can install directly from the following:,In order to load any tarball into the DKMS tree, you must use the following
command:,This command will first inspect the tarball to ensure that it contains a
dkms.conf configuration file for that module.  If it cannot find this file
anywhere within the archive, then the ldtarball will fail.,From here, it will place the source in the tarball into
,. If source already exists in the directory,
it will not overwrite it unless the --force option is specified. If the tarball
is of type ""c"" above and does not contain source, it will only continue to load
the tarball if existing module source is found in
, or if the --force option is specified.,Continuing on, if the tarball is of type ""b"" or ""c"" it will then load any
pre-built binaries found within the tarball into the dkms tree, but will stop
short of installing them.  Thus, all pre-built binaries will then be of in the
, state when checked from the , command.  You can then use the
, command to install any of these binaries.,To create a tarball of type ""1"" above, you need only to take module source and a
dkms.conf file for that module and create a tarball from them.  Tarballs of
type , or type , are created with the , command.  To create
a type , tarball, you must specify the flag , with the
,.,If you choose not to load module source on your system or if you choose not to
load a compiler such as gcc onto your system, DKMS can still be used to install
modules.  It does this through use of DKMS binary only tarballs as explained in
this README under tarballs of type ,.,If your system does not have module source, loading the dkms tarball will fail
because of this.  To avoid this, use the --force flag, as such:,This will load the pre-built binaries into the dkms tree, and create the
directory , which will only contain the
module's dkms.conf configuration file.  Once the tarball is loaded, you can then
use , to install any of the pre-built modules.,Of course, since module source will not be located in your dkms tree, you will
not be able to build any modules with DKMS for this package.,By default, DKMS generates a self signed certificate for signing modules at
build time and signs every module that it builds before it gets compressed in
the configured kernel compression mechanism of choice.,This requires the , command to be present on the system.,Private key and certificate are auto generated the first time DKMS is run and
placed in ,. These certificate files can be pre-populated with
your own certificates of choice.,The location as well can be changed by setting the appropriate variables in
,. For example, to allow usage of the system default
Ubuntu , set the configuration file as follows:,The paths specified in ,, , and , can
use the variable , to represent the target kernel version.,The variable , can also be a , string for a ,, as long as the ,
program supports it.,On an UEFI system with Secure Boot enabled, modules require signing (as
described in the above paragraph) before they can be loaded and the firmware of
the system must know the correct public certificate to verify the module
signature.,For importing the MOK certificate make sure , is installed.,To check if Secure Boot is enabled:,With the appropriate key material on the system, enroll the public key:,You'll be prompted to create a password. Enter it twice, it can also be blank.,Reboot the computer. At boot you'll see the MOK Manager EFI interface:,Press any key to enter it, then select ""Enroll MOK"":,Then select ""Continue"":,And confirm with ""Yes"" when prompted:,After this, enter the password you set up with , in the
previous step:,At this point you are done, select ""OK"" and the computer will reboot trusting
the key for your modules:,After reboot, you can inspect the MOK certificates with the following command:,To check the signature on a built DKMS module that is installed on a system:,The module can now be loaded without issues.,Once DKMS is installed, you can reference its man page for further information

wayland,"Wayland is a replacement for the X11 window system protocol and
architecture with the aim to be easier to develop, extend, and
maintain.,Wayland is the language (protocol) that applications can use to
talk to a display server in order to make themselves visible and
get input from the user (a person). A Wayland server is called
a ""compositor"". Applications are Wayland clients.,Wayland also refers to a system architecture. It is not just a
server-client relationship between a compositor and applications.
There is no single common Wayland server like Xorg is for X11,
but every graphical environment brings with it one of many compositor
implementations. Window management and the end user experience
are often tied to the compositor rather than swappable components.
,A core part of Wayland architecture is libwayland: an inter-process
communication library that translates a protocol definition in XML to a C
language API. This library does not implement Wayland, it merely
encodes and decodes Wayland messages. The actual implementations are
in the various compositor and application toolkit projects.,Wayland does not restrict where and how it is used. A Wayland
compositor could be a standalone display server running on Linux
kernel modesetting and evdev input devices or on many other
operating systems, or a nested compositor that itself is an X11 or
Wayland application (client). Wayland can even be used in
application-internal communication as is done in some web browsers.
,Part of the Wayland project is also the Weston reference
implementation of a Wayland compositor.  Weston can run as an X client
or under Linux KMS and ships with a few demo clients.  The Weston
compositor is a minimal and fast compositor and is suitable for many
embedded and mobile use cases.  ,Information:,Software:,Development:"

extensions are those common among servers descended from X11R7. It
also includes a number of headers that aren't purely protocol related,
but are depended upon by many other X Window System packages to provide
common definitions and porting layer.,Though the protocol specifications herein are authoritative, the
content of the headers is bound by compatibility constraints with older
versions of the X11 suite. If you are looking for a machine-readable
protocol description suitable for code generation or use in new

    ,Migrate existing code to static typing, a function at a time.
      You can freely mix static and dynamic typing within a program, within
      a module or within an expression. No need to
      give up dynamic typing — use static typing
      when it makes sense.
    Often just adding function signatures gives you statically typed code.
    Mypy can infer the types of other
    variables.

    Getting started is easy if you know Python.
    The aim is to support almost all Python language constructs in mypy.

    ,Mypy has a powerful, modern type system with features such as bidirectional type inference,
    generics, callable types, abstract base classes, multiple inheritance and tuple types.

    ,Many commonly used libraries have stubs (statically typed interface
    definitions) that allow mypy to check that your code uses the
    libraries correctly.

Usually, programs are written and documented in English,
and use English at execution time for interacting with users.
This is true not only from within GNU,
but also in a great deal of proprietary and free software.
Using a common language is quite handy for communication
between developers, maintainers and users from all countries.
On the other hand, most people are less comfortable with English than with
their own native language, and would rather be using their mother
tongue for day to day's work, as far as possible.
Many would simply , seeing their computer screen
showing a lot less of English, and far more of their own language.
,
GNU gettext is an important step for the GNU Translation Project,
as it is an asset on which we may build many other steps.
This package offers to programmers, translators, and even users,
a well integrated set of tools and documentation.
Specifically, the GNU gettext utilities are a set of tools
that provides a framework to help other GNU packages produce
multi-lingual messages.
These tools include a set of conventions about
how programs should be written to support message catalogs,
a directory and file naming organization
for the message catalogs themselves,
a runtime library supporting the retrieval of translated messages,
and a few stand-alone programs
to massage in various ways the sets of translatable strings,

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.,minitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework. It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and readable.,minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto minitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec expectations.,minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb co-worker doesn’t replace your linear algorithm with an exponential one!,minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub) object framework.,minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P,minitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case discovery.,Comparing to rspec:,minitest doesn’t reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like: classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to learn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like extract-method refactorings still apply.,minitest/autorun - the easy and explicit way to run all your tests.,minitest/test - a very fast, simple, and clean test system.,minitest/spec - a very fast, simple, and clean spec system.,minitest/mock - a simple and clean mock/stub system.,minitest/benchmark - an awesome way to assert your algorithm’s performance.,minitest/pride - show your pride in testing!,minitest/test_task - a full-featured and clean rake task generator.,Incredibly small and fast runner, but no bells and whistles.,Written by squishy human beings. Software can never be perfect. We will all eventually die.,See design_rationale.rb to see how specs and tests work in minitest.,Given that you’d like to test the following class:,Define your tests as methods beginning with ,.,For matchers support check out:,Add benchmarks to your tests.,Or add them to your specs. If you make benchmarks optional, you’ll need to wrap your benchmarks in a conditional since the methods won’t be defined. In minitest 5, the describe name needs to match ,.,outputs something like:,Output is tab-delimited to make it easy to paste into a spreadsheet.,Mocks and stubs defined using terminology by Fowler & Meszaros at ,:,“Mocks are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. They can throw an exception if they receive a call they don’t expect and are checked during verification to ensure they got all the calls they were expecting.”,Minitest mocks do not support multi-threading. If it works, fine, if it doesn’t you can use regular ruby patterns and facilities like local variables. Here’s an example of asserting that code inside a thread is run:,Mocks and stubs are defined using terminology by Fowler & Meszaros at ,:,“Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test”.,Minitest’s stub method overrides a single method for the duration of the block.,A note on stubbing: In order to stub a method, the method must actually exist prior to stubbing. Use a singleton method to create a new non-existing method:,Ideally, you’ll use a rake task to run your tests (see below), either piecemeal or all at once. BUT! You don’t have to:,There are runtime options available, both from minitest itself, and also provided via plugins. To see them, simply run with ,:,You can set up a rake task to run all your tests by adding this to your Rakefile:,Each of these will generate 4 tasks:,There are a bunch of variables you can supply to rake to modify the run.,To define a plugin, add a file named minitest/XXX_plugin.rb to your project/gem. That file must be discoverable via ruby’s LOAD_PATH (via rubygems or otherwise). Minitest will find and require that file using Gem.find_files. It will then try to call , during startup. The option processor will also try to call , passing the OptionParser instance and the current options hash. This lets you register your own command-line options. Here’s a totally bogus example:,Minitest uses composite reporter to output test results using multiple reporter instances. You can add new reporters to the composite during the init_plugins phase.

You can either do that in your setup at the instance level, like:,or you can extend the Worker class (within the test file!), like:,Use a module.

Welcome to the PLY homepage.  PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc
parsing tools for Python.  If you don't have the slightest idea what
that means, you're probably in the wrong place.  Otherwise, keep
reading.
,
In a nutshell, PLY is nothing more than a straightforward lex/yacc
implementation. Here is a list of its essential features:,
,
 ,
 ,
 ,
, 
The original version of PLY was developed in 2001 for
use in an Introduction to Compilers course where students used
it to build a compiler for a simple Pascal-like language.  Because of
its use in an instructional setting, a lot of work went into providing
extensive error checking.  In addition, this experience was used to
sort out common usability problems. Since then, a variety of
incremental improvements have been made to the system.
, Work on PLY-4.0 has started and represents a major overhaul and
modernization for Python 3.6+.  You can only get this version from the
GitHub repo at ,.
If you looking for a legacy version, you should continue to use version 3.11.
,PLY is no longer maintained as pip-installable package.  Although
no new features are planned, it continues to be maintained and
modernized.  If you want to use the latest version, you need to check
it out from the PLY GitHub page.  If you are looking for a parser
generator with a more modern flavor look at the ,.  ,
, PLY-4.0 started. This version drops Python 2 support, table files, and wide
assortment of crufty legacy code.  You can obtain it from ,.
,
, PLY-3.11 is released.
,
, PLY-3.10 is released.
,
,. PLY-3.9 is released. Minor bug fixes.
,
,. PLY-3.8 is released. Minor bug fixes only.
,
,. PLY-3.7 is released.  Minor bug fixes.
,
,. PLY-3.6 is released.  A fair bit of cleanup and a few new features.
Note: PLY-3.5 had some critical bugs and has been withdrawn. ,
,. PLY-3.4 is released.  Minor bug fixes for Python 3.2,
,. PLY-3.3 is released.  This is a minor bug-fix release.
,
,.  PLY-3.2 is released.  This is just a minor bug-fix release for the PLY-3.x series.
,
,.  PLY-3.1 is released.  This is just a minor bug-fix
release to PLY-3.0.
,
,.  PLY-3.0 is released.  This release adds support for
Python 2.6 and 3.0.  In addition, huge parts of PLY's internals have
been refactored to simplify maintenance and further expansion.
,
,. PLY-2.5 is released.  This release fixes a number of
outstanding bugs, provides improved error handling, and may run even
faster than Ply-2.3.  Note: The PLY-2.4 release was withdrawn due to a
critical error. Please upgrade to PLY-2.5 if you downloaded that version.
,
,. PLY-2.3 is released.  This release makes some performance improvements and fixes a bug with start conditions in the lexer.
,
,. The PLY source code repository is now available on ,.
,
,. PLY-2.2 is released.  This release includes some minor bug fixes and some enhancements to the lex module.
,
,. PLY-2.1 is released.  This release features a variety of major improvements including an
overhaul of the lexer, new parsing features such as support for inherited attributes, embedded actions, and character literals, improved packaging, and new examples.
,
,. ,, a Google group dedicated to PLY has been launched.
,
,. PLY-2.0 is released.  This is the most significant PLY release in several years. Features a completely new
implementation of the LALR(1) table generator that is not only faster, but which also seems to produces correct results!  If you
experienced problems with LALR(1) parsing in PLY-1.x releases, you definitely want to download this version.  Note: PLY-2.0 is the
first in a series of releases that will be adding significant new features to PLY.
,
 ,. PLY-1.8 is released. This release fixes a very
 subtle parsing bug with LALR(1) parsing. , there is still a weird bug in LALR(1) parsing.  Please download version 2.0 instead.
,
 ,. PLY-1.7 is released. This release fixes a number of subtle bugs and adds better support for Unicode.
,
 ,. PLY-1.6 is released.  This release includes a much-awaited patch to fix problems with LALR(1) parsing.  Contributed by Christopher Stawarz.
,
 ,. PLY-1.5 is released.  This releases includes full LALR(1) support (contributed by Elias Ioup).  Check it out!
,
 ,. PLY-1.4 is released.  This includes some nice usability enhancements to
 the output files and cleans up a few things.
,
 ,. PLY-1.3.1 is released.  Patch to fix a minor (but critical) typo in precedence checking code.
,
 ,. PLY-1.3 is released.  Minor bugs fixes.
,
 ,. PLY-1.2 is released.  This release contains a few bug fixes,
 improvements to support Python's optimize mode, and better state management.
,
 ,. PLY-1.1 is released.   This release contains a few
 bug fixes and minor improvements.
,
 ,. PLY-1.0 released.
, 
 PLY-3.2 and newer releases are distributed under a BSD-license. Older versions are licensed under the terms 
of the Lesser GPL (LGPL).
, 
PLY was originally created by , who continues to maintain
it in his spare time---mostly for his own diabolical amusement.   If you like it and want to make it
even better, please submit bug reports and feature requests.   Also consider joining the
, group.

dbus,"What is D-Bus?,Mailing List,Reporting Bugs & Sending Patches,Documentation,Download,Source code,required,D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a ""single instance"" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed. ,D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as ""new hardware device added"" or ""printer queue changed"") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, or through unencrypted TCP/IP suitable for use behind a firewall with shared NFS home directories. (Help wanted with , - the transport mechanism is well-abstracted and extensible.) ,The dbus , and the D-Bus , have been heavily tested in the real world over several years, and are now ""set in stone."" Future changes will either be compatible or versioned appropriately. ,The low-level libdbus reference library has no required dependencies; the reference bus daemon's only , dependency is an XML parser (expat). Higher-level bindings specific to particular frameworks (Qt, GLib, Java, C#, Python, etc.) add more dependencies, but can make more assumptions and are thus much simpler to use. The bindings evolve separately from the low-level libdbus, so some are more mature and ABI-stable than others; check the docs for the binding you plan to use. ,There are also some reimplementations of the D-Bus protocol for languages such as C#, Java, and Ruby. These do not use the libdbus reference implementation. ,It should be noted that the low-level implementation is not primarily designed for application authors to use. Rather, it is a basis for binding authors and a reference for reimplementations. If you are able to do so it is recommended that you use one of the higher level bindings or implementations. A list of these can be found on the ,. ,The , is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from. ,D-Bus is very portable to any Linux or UNIX flavor, and the port to Windows is mostly finished. ,If you have any trouble with D-Bus or suggestions for improvement, bug reports and comments are very welcome. ,Get on D-Bus today! ,All D-Bus discussion is currently on ,. ,Please report bugs (and submit merge requests) for the D-Bus Specification and the reference implementation , through the ,.,For other implementations and bindings, please use the bug tracker for the appropriate implementation. For example, GDBus bugs are tracked in ,, and sd-bus bugs are tracked in ,.,Ideally, include test suite coverage with your patch; or if you report a bug, it's good to add a test that fails even if you don't have a patch otherwise.,Patches to improve test coverage are very welcome, though D-Bus is already among the best-covered codebases around. ,Some stuff from the doc/ subdirectory is prebuilt and browsable here. If you're new to D-Bus, the tutorial is probably the best place to start (even though it is very incomplete, the basics are covered). ,Generic D-Bus protocol information: ,Docs specific to the reference implementation, dbus:,Articles from around the web, including some tutorials: ,dbus is the reference implementation of D-Bus. Released versions can be downloaded from the , and are available in all major Linux distributions. If in doubt, use your distribution's packages. ,The current , branch is ,. This is the recommended version for most purposes. ,The current , branch is ,. This is still supported, but only for security fixes: only use this version when upgrading from older stable releases, or preparing security updates for frozen/stable distributions.,Older branches such as 1.10.x have reached end-of-life and are unlikely to have any more releases, but distributors who still provide security support for an older version are invited to share backported patches via the older branches in the same git repository.

,RapidFuzz is a fast string matching library for Python and C++, which is using the string similarity calculations from ,. However there are a couple of aspects that set RapidFuzz apart from FuzzyWuzzy:,There are several ways to install RapidFuzz, the recommended methods
are to either use ,(the Python package manager) or
, (an open-source, cross-platform, package manager),RapidFuzz can be installed with , the following way:,There are pre-built binaries (wheels) of RapidFuzz for MacOS (10.9 and later), Linux x86_64 and Windows. Wheels for armv6l (Raspberry Pi Zero) and armv7l (Raspberry Pi) are available on ,.,   ,If you run into this error on Windows the reason is most likely, that the , is not installed, which is required to find C++ Libraries (The C++ 2019 version includes the 2015, 2017 and 2019 version).,RapidFuzz can be installed with ,:,RapidFuzz can be installed directly from the source distribution by cloning the repository. This requires a C++17 capable compiler.,Some simple functions are shown below. A complete documentation of all functions can be found ,.,Scorers in RapidFuzz can be found in the modules , and ,.,The process module makes it compare strings to lists of strings. This is generally more
performant than using the scorers directly from Python.
Here are some examples on the usage of processors in RapidFuzz:,The full documentation of processors can be found ,The following benchmark gives a quick performance comparison between RapidFuzz and FuzzyWuzzy.
More detailed benchmarks for the string metrics can be found in the ,. For this simple comparison I generated a list of 10.000 strings with length 10, that is compared to a sample of 100 elements from this list:,The first benchmark compares the performance of the scorers in FuzzyWuzzy and RapidFuzz when they are used directly
from Python in the following way:,The following graph shows how many elements are processed per second with each of the scorers. There are big performance differences between the different scorers. However each of the scorers is faster in RapidFuzz,The second benchmark compares the performance when the scorers are used in combination with cdist in the following
way:,The following graph shows how many elements are processed per second with each of the scorers. In RapidFuzz the usage of scorers through processors like , is a lot faster than directly using it. That's why they should be used whenever possible.,If you are using RapidFuzz for your work and feel like giving a bit of your own benefit back to support the project, consider sending us money through GitHub Sponsors or PayPal that we can use to buy us free time for the maintenance of this great library, to fix bugs in the software, review and integrate code contributions, to improve its features and documentation, or to just take a deep breath and have a cup of tea every once in a while. Thank you for your support.,Support the project through , or via ,:,.,RapidFuzz is licensed under the MIT license since I believe that everyone should be able to use it without being forced to adopt the GPL license. That's why the library is based on an older version of fuzzywuzzy that was MIT licensed as well.

or keys with all the various applications. For example different applications
look for their trust anchor certificates in different places, and configuring
each application with a client certificate is a laborious task.,Developers suffer because when an application needs to use security
(like TLS), the application needs to provide support for all sorts of
security configuration, cetrificate/key file locations, security exceptions,
smart cards, and so on. And so progress suffers because there's no foundation
for consistent place to store security stuff on the desktop.,

solve the above problems.,We can use PKCS#11 to make apps more secure (through the support use of
smart cards), more usable (through common storage), and easier to develop

ack,"ack is a grep-like source code search tool.,What's new in ack?,
        Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous
        trees of source code, ack is written in
        portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of the power of
        Perl's regular expressions.
        ,
            The new repeatable --not option lets you get more precise matches. If you want to search for ""dogs"" but not
            if ""cats"" or ""fish"" are on the line, use
        ,

,
            The error message ack displays when the regex passed is invalid
            has been improved. The message is more readable and includes a
            pointer to the offending part of the regex. For example:
        ,
            A new option , groups together lines of
            output that are within N lines of each other in the file.  This is
            useful when looking for matches that are related to each other.
        ,
            For example, these results:
        ,
            look like this with ,.
        ,
            The , option, which tells ack to only find whole-word
            matches, did not always work if your pattern began or ended with
            puncutation.  ack would make guesses as to what your intent was,
            but it was not well-defined.  Now, ack disallows regexes that
            begin or end with non-word characters.
        ,
            This means that if you use ,, the new ack
            will not allow it, whereas ack 2.x would.
        ,
            For those without , always on, the ,
            will be easier for when you do want to use it.
        ,
            Smart-case matching makes ack do a case-insensitive search unless
            the pattern being matched has a capital letter in it.
        ,
            If you use , in your .ackrc, you can use
            , to force case-sensitivity instead of having to use
            , (which still works).
        ,
            Run times for ack 3 compared to ack 2.22 are 30-40% faster
            because of removal of unused infrastructure for plugins.
        ,
        ack is simple to install, via CPAN, package or simple download. ,.

,
Since CakeCmd can extract files from a corrupted zip archive in many cases that
popular unzippers do not extract (eg. in case of some CRC failure), so using
CakeCmd unzipper directly/indirectly you can extract text content from a damaged
docx file via this script, as long as the relevant xml files holding the text
information are extracted with non-zero content from corresponding docx file.
Because CakeCmd is ignoring some data sanity checks on the archive, at times
these extracted files have quite some amount of junk in them.
,
You can also try to repair corrupted docx file using programs like
, (,),
,,
,, and
,. GUI version of winrar gives an option to keep broken extracted files as well.
,
MC (Midnight Commander) fans can add following binding in ~/.mc/bindings and
view the text content of .docx file by hitting F3 function key after selecting
the concerned docx document.
,
You can add following lines in your ~/.vimrc to view the text content of a .docx
file directly when using vim.
,
Note that above .vimrc addition will allow you to view the text content of .docx
files specified as command line argument to vim, but not of those read using
"":r file.docx"".
,
Please refer to
, for more information on
autocmd.
,
You can add following lines in your ~/.emacs file to view the text content of
a .docx file directly when using emacs.

enhanced version of the
, core, our enhanced version of ,, many carefully written Lua
libraries, lots of high quality ,, and
most of their external dependencies. It is designed to help developers easily
build scalable web applications, web services, and dynamic web gateways.,By taking advantage of various well-designed , modules (most
of which are developed by the OpenResty team themselves), OpenResty, effectively
turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web developers
can use the Lua programming language to script various existing nginx C modules
and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance web applications that
are capable to handle 10K ~ 1000K+ connections in a single box.,OpenResty, aims to run your server-side web app completely in the , server,
leveraging ,'s event model to do non-blocking I/O not only
with the HTTP clients, but also with remote backends like MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Memcached, and Redis.,Real-world applications of OpenResty, range from dynamic web portals and web
gateways, web application firewalls, web service platforms for mobile
apps/advertising/distributed storage/data analytics,
to full-fledged dynamic web applications and web sites. The hardware used to
run OpenResty, also ranges from very big metals to embedded devices with very
limited resources. It is not uncommon for our production users to serve billions
of requests daily for millions of active users with just a handful of machines.,OpenResty, is , an , fork. It is a higher
level application and gateway platform using Nginx as a component.
Most of the patches applied to the , core in OpenResty, have
already been submitted to the official , team and most of
the patches submitted have also been accepted. We constantly import the latest
features and bug fixes from the official , team, the official LuaJIT repository, and other sources.,See , for the complete list of software bundled

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,If you want to write an option parser, and have it be good, there are
two ways to do it.  The Right Way, and the Wrong Way.,The Wrong Way is to sit down and write an option parser.  We've all done
that.,The Right Way is to write some complex configurable program with so many
options that you hit the limit of your frustration just trying to
manage them all, and defer it with duct-tape solutions until you see
exactly to the core of the problem, and finally snap and write an
awesome option parser.,If you want to write an option parser, don't write an option parser.
Write a package manager, or a source control system, or a service
restarter, or an operating system.  You probably won't end up with a
good one of those, but if you don't give up, and you are relentless and
diligent enough in your procrastination, you may just end up with a very
nice option parser.,This would give you support for any of the following:,Read the tests at the bottom of , for more examples of
what this puppy can do.,The following types are supported, and defined on ,If a type is an array of values not on this list, then those are
considered valid values.  For instance, in the example above, the
, option can only be one of ,, ,, or ,,
and any other value will be rejected.,When parsing unknown fields, ,, ,, and , will be
interpreted as their JavaScript equivalents.,You can also mix types and values, or multiple types, in a list.  For
instance , would allow a value to be set to
either a Number or null.  When types are ordered, this implies a
preference, and the first type that can be used to properly interpret
the value will be used.,To define a new type, add it to ,.  Each item in that
hash is an object with a , member and a , method.  The
, member is an object that matches what goes in the type list.  The
, method is a function that gets called with ,.  Validate methods should assign , to the valid
value of , if it can be handled properly, or return boolean
, if it cannot.,You can also call , to clean up a
config object and remove its invalid properties.,By default, nopt outputs a warning to standard error when invalid values for
known options are found.  You can change this behavior by assigning a method
to ,.  This method will be called with
the offending ,.,If no , is assigned, then it will console.error
its whining.  If it is assigned to boolean , then the warning is
suppressed.,Yes, they are supported.  If you define options like this:,Then this will work:,Shorthands are a hash of shorter option names to a snippet of args that
they expand to.,If multiple one-character shorthands are all combined, and the
combination does not unambiguously match any other option or shorthand,
then they will be broken up into their constituent parts.  For example:,The config object returned by nopt is given a special member called
,, which is an object with the following fields:,Node programs are called with more or less the exact argv as it appears
in C land, after the v8 and node-specific options have been plucked off.
As such, , is always , and , is always the
JavaScript program being run.,That's usually not very useful to you.  So they're sliced off by
default.  If you want them, then you can pass in , as the last
argument, or any other number that you'd like to slice off the start of
the list.,

for generating SPIR-V:,For just validating (not generating code), substitute these calls:,See , and the usage of it in , for more
details. There is a block comment giving more detail above the calls for
,.,This interface is in roughly the first 2/3 of ,, and referred to
as the , interface, as all the entry points start ,.,The , interface takes a ""compiler"" call-back object, which it calls after
building call back that is passed the AST and can then execute a back end on it.,The following is a simplified resulting run-time call stack:,In practice, , takes shader strings, default version, and
warning/error and other options for controlling compilation.,This interface is located , and exposes functionality similar to the C++ interface. The following snippet is a complete example showing how to compile GLSL into SPIR-V 1.5 for Vulkan 1.2.,Initial lexical analysis is done by the preprocessor in
,, and then refined by a GLSL scanner
in ,.  There is currently no use of flex.,Code is parsed using bison on , with the
aid of a symbol table and an AST.  The symbol table is not passed on to
the back-end; the intermediate representation stands on its own.
The tree is built by the grammar productions, many of which are
offloaded into ,, and by ,.,The intermediate representation is very high-level, and represented
as an in-memory tree.   This serves to lose no information from the
original program, and to have efficient transfer of the result from
parsing to the back-end.  In the AST, constants are propagated and
folded, and a very small amount of dead code is eliminated.,To aid linking and reflection, the last top-level branch in the AST
lists all global symbols.,The primary algorithm of the back-end compiler is to traverse the
tree (high-level intermediate representation), and create an internal
object code representation.  There is an example of how to do this
in ,.,Reduction of the tree to a linear byte-code style low-level intermediate
representation is likely a good way to generate fully optimized code.,There is currently some dead old-style linker-type code still lying around.,Memory pool: parsing uses types derived from C++ , types, using a
custom allocator that puts them in a memory pool.  This makes allocation
of individual container/contents just few cycles and deallocation free.

freetype2,"billion,Harmony,much,not,FreeType is a freely available software
library to render fonts.,It is written in C, designed to be small, efficient,
highly customizable, and portable while capable of
producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most
vector and bitmap font formats.,Some products that use FreeType for rendering fonts on
screen or on paper, either exclusively or partially:,Counting the above products only, you get more than a
, devices that contain FreeType.,This new release brings you a completely updated and
enhanced , demo program, which now
combines the functionality of almost all other graphical
FreeType demo programs into a single application based on
the Qt framework.,Another two noteworthy features are related to OpenType
fonts: The ‘COLR’ v1 API is now considered as
stable, and
the , is supported.,Other news and changes can be found in the
,.,This is a maintenance release. All users should upgrade.
A list of the most important changes and fixes can be

,.,The main new feature of this release is support for
OpenType fonts with an ‘SVG’ table, using an
external SVG rendering library. Other changes, fixes, and
improvements are documented
,.,This is a maintenance release with no significant
changes. For more details on the various fixes and
changes please
see ,.,Our new release brings an additional rendering module to
create Signed Distance Fields (SDF) for glyphs; it also
introduces an experimental interface to access
,
fonts.
,As usual, there are many more fixes and features; please
see ,
for more.,We are now using the infrastructure of
the ,. All bug issues have been
imported (kudos to Anurag Thakur for doing this tedious
job!), together with the git repositories, which have been
renamed

the ,.,A new maintenance release, fixing bytecode hinting of
OpenType variation fonts and cmap processing of PCF fonts,
among other things. Check
the , for more fixes.,This release brings one notable feature, namely support
for color-layered outline glyphs (for example, scalable
emoji glyphs). Additionally, the API reference has been
completely overhauled and modernized, as already
announced.,As usual, many minor fixes and corrections have been
applied also; a detailed list is
given ,.,A revamped version of the FreeType website is available
for preview ,.
It includes a complete interface redesign, and uses
markdown as input which greatly improves maintainability.
Comments are welcome.,This is a maintenance release; most importantly fixing
correct handling of Type 1 fonts with flex features,
which was broken in version 2.9. An overview of the
remaining changes is
given ,.
All users should upgrade.,FreeType version 2.9, the first release of a new
‘minor’ series, is now available for download.
The main reason for starting a new series is Ewald Hew's
GSoC contribution of making Adobe's CFF engine handle
Type 1 fonts also, greatly improving the rendering
quality of this ancient but still important font
format.,If you are going to use variation fonts, please update to
this version since it comes with some important fixes.
More information on this and other changes can be
found ,.,FreeType 2.8.1 has been released. This is mainly a
maintenance release with one important change: By default,
FreeType now offers high quality LCD-optimized output
without resorting to ClearType techniques of resolution
tripling and filtering. In this method,
called ,, each color channel is generated
separately after shifting the glyph outline, capitalizing
on the fact that the color grids on LCD panels are shifted
by a third of a pixel. This output is indistinguishable
from ClearType with a light 3-tap filter.,See
,
for a extensive list of changes; noteworthy bug fixes are
correct handling of B/W TrueType hinting and some OpenType
variation font handling issues.,FreeType 2.8 has been released. CFF2 support and
OpenType variation font handling is now complete; the
auto-hinter now understands 25 more scripts, for example
N'Ko and Tifinagh.,See
,
for a list of changes; noteworthy bug fixes are the
handling of TrueType fonts: unhinted loading didn't work
as expected, and the light auto-hinter used incorrect
metrics.,The FreeType project was accepted to be part
of , 2017! Here's , to our ideas list – if you have another
one, please write to
our , so that we can discuss your suggestions,
eventually adding them to the list. And if you want to
participate as a student, now is the time to discuss
everything, again using the mailing list.,FreeType 2.7.1 has been released. The most important
news is preliminary support of Adobe's new CFF2 font
format and variation fonts as specified in the new
OpenType specification version 1.8. It also fixes
the handling of raw CID fonts (which might be found in PDF
files),See
,
for a list of changes.,We start a new ‘minor’ series, which finally
allows us to activate a new default mode for bytecode
hinting (see also the announcements below for version
2.6.4 and 2.6.5): Subpixel hinting, also known as
ClearType hinting.,In case you are already using subpixel hinting (for
example, by using the ‘Infinality patches’ as
provided by some GNU/Linux or BSD distributions, or
directly
from ,),
be noted that the new mode might provide subtle
differences; the code was simplified to make
it , faster. If you are used to the old
full-pixel hinting, you will see many rendering changes.
If you really dislike them, you can disable them at
compile time or using the
new , environment
variable.,A description of the remaining changes can be
found ,,
as usual.,This release is almost identical to the previous version,
with two differences.
,FreeType 2.6.4 has been released. The most important
change is a new bytecode hinting mode for TrueType fonts
that finally activates subpixel hinting (a.k.a. ClearType
hinting) by default.,The new release also brings support for the following new
scripts in the auto-hinter: Armenian, Cherokee, Ethiopic,
Georgian, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Sinhala, and
Tamil.,See
,
for a detailed list of changes.,FreeType 2.6.3 has been released. It brings support for
four new Asian scripts in the auto-hinter (Khmer, Myanmar,
Kannada, and Bengali), together with other, minor
improvements and bug fixes.,See
,
for a detailed list of changes.,FreeType 2.6.2 ships with three interesting details for
users and developers of rendering libraries that deal with
text. ,.,FreeType 2.6.2 has been released. This is a minor
release that mainly provides better handling of malformed
fonts. All users should upgrade.,A new feature is stem darkening support for the
auto-hinter. Note, however, that it is off by default,
since most graphic systems don't provide correct linear
alpha blending with gamma correction, which is crucial for
a good appearance. For the same reason, stem darkening
for the CFF engine is now off by default, too.,See
,
for a more detailed list of changes.,FreeType 2.6.1 has been released. This is a minor
release that corrects problems with CFF metrics, and that
provides better handling of malformed fonts. Two notably
new features are auto-hinting support for the Lao script
and a simple interface for accessing named instances in GX
TrueType variation fonts.,See
,
for a list of changes.,FreeType 2.6 has been released. This is a new major
release that provides a better (and simpler) thread-safety
model. Among other new features we now have auto-hinting
support for Arabic and Thai, together with much improved
handling of Apple's GX TrueType variation font format.,See
,
for a list of changes.,Besides user support and fixing bugs, your money will
help me implement the following issues.,FreeType 2.5.3 has been released. All users should
upgrade due to fixed vulnerability in the CFF driver
(CVE-2014-2240).,Its main new feature is much enhanced support of
auto-hinting SFNT fonts (i.e., TrueType and CFF fonts) due
to the use of
the , library. A
more detailed description of this and other changes can be
found ,.,FreeType 2.5.2 has been released. It fixes a serious bug
introduced in version 2.5.1; all users should upgrade.,A listing of the changes can be
found ,.,FreeType 2.5.1 has been released, providing three major
new features.,Among other changes I want to mention that FreeType's
TrueType debugger (,) has been made more
versatile. An exhaustive list of changes can be
found ,.,Thanks to a very generous donation by Pierre Arnaud
from ,, the
pledgie campaign for FreeType has reached its goal. I
want to say thank you again to all donors! Of course,
noone stops you from further donating to the campaign
:-),After integration of Adobe's CFF module and Google's
color emoji support, I will use the next months to work on
the remaining issues that I've promised to implement.
Stay tuned!,FreeType 2.5 has been released. A major new feature is
support for color embedded bitmaps (eg. color emoji),
contributed by Behdad Esfahbod on behalf of Google.
Additionally, Adobe's CFF engine is now the default, which
makes a good reason to change from the 2.4.x to the 2.5.x
series.,On the technical side, the property API to access
FreeType module parameters (,
and ,) is now declared as stable.,As usual,

qca-qt5,"
,Taking a hint from the similarly-named ,, QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API, using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API from the implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly depending on any particular cryptographic library. This allows one to easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without even needing to recompile the application! QCA should work everywhere Qt does, including Windows/Unix/MacOSX.
,Latest QCA depends on ,.
,The application includes <QtCrypto> and links to libqca, which provides the 'wrapper API' and plugin loader. Crypto functionality is determined during runtime, and plugins are loaded from the 'crypto' subfolder of the Qt Library Paths.
,The base QCA library is considered mostly complete. Future development may include OCSP, shared certificate management, and improving the plugin API. However, there is no development plan for the base library at this time. Work will continue on the various plugins though, in order to get them into a release-quality state.
,QCA follows a typical API/ABI compatibility scheme. Versions use the ""major.minor.patch"" format. Major versions of QCA may be incompatible with each other, minor versions are backwards compatible within the same major version, and patch versions are forwards and backwards compatible within the same minor version. This is the same scheme that Qt itself uses.
,API documentation in HTML format is included in the source distribution.
The documentation for the current version is also ,.
,The latest release packages can be found in the ,.
,QCA has built-in support for the SHA1 and MD5 hash algorithms, and a weak random number source. To perform any other crypto operations (or to utilize improved versions of the built-in ones), an appropriate provider plugin is needed. There are several available so far, and you could always write your own, too.
,As of QCA 2.1, the latest plugins are included in the main tarball and don’t need to be downloaded separately.
,The latest source can be found in the 'qca' module of the KDE Git.  The code can also be browsed ,.

""Find all the links of class ,"", or ""Find all the
links whose urls match ""foo.com"", or ""Find the table heading that's
got bold text, then give me that text.""

best compression ratios currently possible.,libheif makes use of , for HEIF image decoding and x265 for encoding.
For AVIF, libaom, dav1d, svt-av1, or rav1e are used as codecs.,libheif has support for decoding,The encoder supports:,The library has a C API for easy integration and wide language support.
Note that the API is still work in progress and may still change.,The decoder automatically supports both HEIF and AVIF through the same API. No changes are required to existing code to support AVIF.
The encoder can be switched between HEIF and AVIF simply by setting , or ,

Hence, you can use the C++ API and still be binary compatible.
Code using the C++ API is much less verbose than using the C API directly.,There is also an experimental Go API, but this is not stable yet.,This library uses either a standard autoconf/automake build system or CMake.,Using autoconf/automake for compilation is deprecated.
Starting with v1.14.0, CMake is the preferred build tool.
While autoconf/automake might still work for some time to come, not all options are available for it.,When using autoconf, run , to build the configuration scripts,

You can choose this individually for each codec backend in the CMake settings.
Compiling a codec backend as dynamic plugin will generate a shared library that is installed in the system together with libheif.
The advantage is that only the required plugins have to be installed and libheif has fewer dependencies.,The plugins are loaded from the colon-separated (semicolon-separated on Windows) list of directories stored in the environment variable ,.
If this variable is empty, they are loaded from a directory specified in the CMake configuration.
You can also add plugin directories programmatically.,A current benchmark of the AVIF encoders (as of 14 Oct 2022) can be found on the Wiki page

                As with any application, reading through the documentation is the best way to get started.
                But realizing the desire to get your feet wet quickly, you should 
                glance over this page to get a feel for what the Wrapper can do.
            ,
                Then to get up and running, at a minimum you will need to read over
                the , section.

                The Wrapper provides a very large feature set.
                At some point, it is suggested that you look over the ,
                to get a feel for the full power of the Java Service Wrapper.
            ,
                
,
                If you run into problems or have any questions, the preferred method for getting help is posting a message to the
                ,.
            ,
                The Java Service Wrapper is an application which has evolved out of a
                desire to solve a number of problems common to many Java applications.
                Below you will find the main features of the Wrapper:
            ,
                    The Java Service Wrapper makes it possible to install a Java Application as a Windows Service.
                    Likewise, the scripts shipped with the Wrapper also make it 
                    very easy to install a Java Application as a Daemon process on UNIX systems.
                ,
                    The Wrapper correctly handles ""user's logouts"" under Windows, 
                    service dependencies, and the ability to run services which interact with the desktop.
                ,
                    Please visit the documentation pages below for instructions:
                    ,
                    As the use of Java expands, your applications have been written to provide a variety of mission and critical services.
                    These services must be able to provide a high level of reliability.
                    In an ideal world, only software which is 100% bug free will ever be released and installed.
                    However, history has shown this not to be the case.
                    Almost every application suffers from quality issues at one point or another during their life-cycle.
                    Applications hang, crash, run out of memory or suffer from any number of problems.
                    Where possible, problems are fixed quickly without significant service outages.
                    There are times however, when fixing a problem can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to solve in a short time period.
                ,
                    The Wrapper monitors a JVM process and automatically restarts it if the JVM has crashed or hung.
                    This process takes just a few seconds once the Wrapper has decided there is a problem.
                    There is also a way to configure the Wrapper to ,.
                ,
                    While these advanced features of the Java Service Wrapper will not make every problem go away,
                    they will help you to sleep easier knowing that if there is a problem, the Wrapper will be there
                    to keep things up and running until you can get into the office to check the logs. 
                    Say goodbye to those emergency phone calls!
                ,
                    Write once, run everywhere configuration.  Java has been marketed as a ""Write Once, Run Everywhere"" programming language.
                    While this is true for many aspects of an application, the developer is often plagued with
                    having to write complicated, platform-specific scripts, which are tasked
                    with building up class paths and collecting other system information necessary to launch an application.
                ,
                    The Java Service Wrapper helps to relieve the developer of the troublesome task
                    by providing a set of scripts for a wide range of platforms that can be
                    used as is to launch and run almost any Java Application controlled by the Wrapper.
                ,
                    The Wrapper moves all JVM configuration into a platform independent configuration file
                    ,.
                    See the examples on , section for details.
                ,
                    The Java Service Wrapper provides a way for a Java Application to request that its own JVM be restarted.
                    This can be useful in a number of cases.
                    Applications may wish to restart after having had their configuration files modified.
                    Or the application may simply need to be restarted to avoid problems with a memory or resource leak of some kind.
                ,
                    JVM restarts can be triggered from within the JVM by making a call to
                    ,.
                    See the , 
                    in , for more details.
                ,
                    There are also more passive ways to trigger restarts.
                    The Wrapper has the ability to ,
                    and trigger shutdowns or restarts whenever certain text is detected.
                ,
                    The Wrapper can also be configured to either restart another JVM instance or shutdown normally
                    , returned by a JVM.
                ,
                    The Java Service Wrapper provides a wide range of configuration properties which can be used to configure the JVM 
                    in any way possible ,.
                    The Wrapper configuration file "",""
                    also provides a number of properties to allow you to configure things like ,
                    and how the Wrapper is installed as a service.
                ,
                    See the , section for details on what is possible.
                    Be sure you have read over the , section
                    before jumping into the configuration file ,.
                ,
                    By using the Wrapper's standard scripts, and , in the configuration file
                    ,, it is usually possible to create an application
                    which requires no further complicated installation than simply expanding an archive file into a directory of the user's choice.
                ,
                    While the Java Service Wrapper does not attempt to, nor should it, replace any of the great Logging Tools available,
                    it does provide a number of properties to configure ,.
                    This output can be logged to any combination of the console, a file, or the ""Event Log"" (Windows) or ""syslog"" (UNIX).
                ,
                    
,
                    can be critical to tracking down problems with an application.
                    Without the Wrapper, when a JVM is being run as a Service under Windows,
                    or as a Daemon under UNIX, the console output would normally be lost.
                    The Wrapper makes sure that all console output is logged.
                ,
                    Java-based Logging Tools are only capable of logging output generated from within the JVM.
                    If the JVM crashes or prints out low level messages such as thread dumps, there is normally no way to log it.
                    The Wrapper logs all console output from the JVM process, regardless of its source. This means 
                    that the records of any crashes will survive even after the Wrapper has restarted the JVM.
                ,
                    See the , section for further details.
                ,
                The Wrapper is known to work with Oracle, OpenJDK, IBM, Blackdown and BEA WebLogic JRockit JVMs without any problems.
                If you get a chance to test any other JVMs, please be sure and let us know the results.

                (Wrapper versions prior to 3.4.0 supported JVM versions back to 1.2.x.)
            ,
                    The Wrapper can be used with Java 1.2.x versions. However, some functions are disabled
                    due to this version of Java's lack of support for 
                    ,.
                    Shutdown Hooks were implemented with the 1.3.0 release of Java.

because you have nothing to hide is no different from
saying you don't care about free speech because you have
nothing to say.   – Edward Snowden

Using encryption helps to protect your privacy and the privacy of the
people you communicate with.  Encryption makes life difficult for bulk
surveillance systems.  GnuPG is one of the tools that Snowden used to
uncover the secrets of the NSA.

Autoconf is an extensible package of M4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a
configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
operating system features that the package can use, in the form of M4
macro calls.
,
Producing configuration scripts using Autoconf
requires ,.  You should
install GNU M4 (at least version 1.4.6, although 1.4.13 or later is
recommended) before configuring Autoconf,
so that Autoconf's configure script can find it.  The configuration
scripts produced by Autoconf are self-contained, so their users do not
need to have Autoconf (or GNU M4).

You may also find more information about Autoconf by looking at your
local documentation.  For example, you might try looking in

  GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
  Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.  SASL is
  used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP, XMPP) to request
  authentication from clients, and in clients to authenticate against
  servers.
,
  GNU SASL consists of a C library (libgsasl), a command-line
  application (gsasl), and a manual.  The library supports the
  ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, EXTERNAL, GS2-KRB5, GSSAPI, LOGIN,
  NTLM, OPENID20, PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, SCRAM-SHA-256,
  SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS, SAML20, and SECURID mechanisms.
,
  The library is portable because it does not do network communication
  by itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling application.  The
  library is flexible with regards to the authorization infrastructure
  used, as it utilizes callbacks into the application to decide
  whether an user is authorized or not.
,
  The GNU SASL Library (lib/) is licensed under the GNU Lesser General
  Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 (or later).  The GNU project
  typically uses the GNU General Public License (GPL) for libraries,
  and not the LGPL, but for this project we decided that we would get
  more help from the community if we used the LGPLv2.1+, as other free
  SASL implementations exists.  See also

libpng,"
, is the official PNG reference library.  It supports almost
all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for
over 23 years.  The home site for development versions (i.e., may be
,
buggy or subject to change or include experimental features) is ,, and
the place to go for questions about the library is the , mailing list.

,
libpng is available as ANSI C (C89) source code and requires ,
or later (, or later recommended for performance and security
reasons).  The current public release, ,, is a maintenance
release with various fixes and improvements, including a change to signal large
PNG chunks as benign errors rather than hard errors.

,
,
The portability notice should not come as a particular surprise
to anyone who has added libpng support to an application this millenium; the
manual has warned of it since at least July 2000.  (Specifically:
,  OK, so the version number was off a
bit...and the grammar, too, but who's counting?)  Those whose apps depend on
the older API need not panic, however (for now); libpng 1.2.x continues to
get security fixes, as has 1.0.x for well over a decade.  (Greg no longer
bothers to list either series here; enough's enough, folks.  Update those
apps now!)

,
The 1.5.x and later series also include a new, more thorough test program
(,) and a new , header file that
tracks what features were enabled or disabled when libpng was built.  On
the other hand, they no longer internally include the , header
file, so applications that formerly depended on , to provide
that will now need to include it explicitly.
Complete differences relative to libpng 1.4.x
are detailed ,.

      ,
      Many (most?) versions of libpng read uninitialized memory when handling
      empty sCAL chunks, and they handle malformed sCAL chunks (those lacking
      a delimiting NULL between the internal strings) incorrectly.
      This vulnerability has been assigned ID

  Copyright © 1996-2022,2023 by Thomas E. Dickey,See the ncurses release , or the ,Ncurses has an involved history:, is the work of dozens of people. Some
  are listed in the credits.,My involvement with ncurses dates back to the 1.8.1 release. I
  was looking for an avenue to make a SystemV-based curses support
  resizable windows (e.g., in an xterm). This is easily achievable
  with BSD-curses, but not with the distributed versions of SystemV
  curses. Ncurses 1.8.1 was too immature (dumped core, was not
  portable, etc).,I revisited it in mid-1994, after an initial pass of making
  , auto-configured. Ncurses 1.8.5
  was advertised as 100% SVr4 compatible. I designed a minimal
  interface for ,, proposing it to Zeyd,
  who promised it would be in 1.8.6 (it wasn't). Coming back to
  1.8.7, I found that the color support was broken (specifically
  for ,, which I had colorized using
  PDCurses with MS-DOS). Since the package is useless to me unless
  it implements faithfully the SVr4 interface, I approached Eric in
  early 1995 with my growing list of problems. For more
  information, see the discussion of the ,.,Since then, I've corrected the implementation of color,
  terminal modes, implemented resizing, as well as the
  configuration scripts, and resolved numerous reliability and
  portability issues.,There is further work to do: the screen optimization has not
  been rigorously tested, there are interesting problems to work
  out with internationalization, etc.,Here are links to the changelog for ncurses:,See the ,
  file in the sources for an explanation of the configure script's
  options.,Starting with release 5.8, the source includes scripts which
  automate the process of building tarballs of useful subsets.
  These are,The , program is commonly
  distributed with ncurses, though it is not part of ncurses.,The current terminfo/termcap sources are available via http.
  They require tic/infocmp from ncurses 6.2 or later, since they

  xterm's terminfo file for ncurses, and use , (in a script) to
  check for mismatches. Some packagers simply append xterm's file
  to the ncurses terminal database, which creates more problems
  than it solves.,Beginning with ,,
  ncurses has been ported to Win32 console using MinGW. I have
  built it both on Windows7 as well as via cross-compiling from
  FreeBSD, Fedora and Debian. From the latter, I make occasional
  builds which you may find useful:,Stable releases are mentioned on ,.,Development versions are announced on the

        It allows easy use of sophisticated DVD navigation features such as DVD menus,

        provided through a simple API which provides the DVD playback as a single

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,This regex implementation is backwards-compatible with the standard 're' module, but offers additional functionality.,The re module's behaviour with zero-width matches changed in Python 3.7, and this module follows that behaviour when compiled for Python 3.7.,Python 2 is no longer supported. The last release that supported Python 2 was 2021.11.10.,This module is targeted at CPython. It expects that all codepoints are the same width, so it won't behave properly with PyPy outside U+0000..U+007F because PyPy stores strings as UTF-8.,The regex module releases the GIL during matching on instances of the built-in (immutable) string classes, enabling other Python threads to run concurrently. It is also possible to force the regex module to release the GIL during matching by calling the matching methods with the keyword argument ,. The behaviour is undefined if the string changes during matching, so use it , when it is guaranteed that that won't happen.,This module supports Unicode 15.0.0. Full Unicode case-folding is supported.,There are 2 kinds of flag: scoped and global. Scoped flags can apply to only part of a pattern and can be turned on or off; global flags apply to the entire pattern and can only be turned on.,The scoped flags are: ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,.,The global flags are: ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,.,If neither the ,, , nor , flag is specified, it will default to , if the regex pattern is a Unicode string and , if it's a bytestring.,The , flag makes fuzzy matching attempt to improve the fit of the next match that it finds.,The , flag makes fuzzy matching search for the best match instead of the next match.,In order to be compatible with the re module, this module has 2 behaviours:, behaviour (old behaviour, compatible with the re module):,Please note that the re module's behaviour may change over time, and I'll endeavour to match that behaviour in version 0., behaviour (new behaviour, possibly different from the re module):,If no version is specified, the regex module will default to ,.,The regex module supports both simple and full case-folding for case-insensitive matches in Unicode. Use of full case-folding can be turned on using the , flag. Please note that this flag affects how the , flag works; the , flag itself does not turn on case-insensitive matching.,Version 0 behaviour: the flag is off by default.,Version 1 behaviour: the flag is on by default.,It's not possible to support both simple sets, as used in the re module, and nested sets at the same time because of a difference in the meaning of an unescaped , in a set.,For example, the pattern , is treated in the version 0 behaviour (simple sets, compatible with the re module) as:,but in the version 1 behaviour (nested sets, enhanced behaviour) as:,Version 0 behaviour: only simple sets are supported.,Version 1 behaviour: nested sets and set operations are supported.,All groups have a group number, starting from 1.,Groups with the same group name will have the same group number, and groups with a different group name will have a different group number.,The same name can be used by more than one group, with later captures 'overwriting' earlier captures. All the captures of the group will be available from the , method of the match object.,Group numbers will be reused across different branches of a branch reset, eg. , has only group 1. If groups have different group names then they will, of course, have different group numbers, eg. , has group 1 (""foo"") and group 2 (""bar"").,In the regex , there are 2 groups:,If you want to prevent , from being group 2, you need to name it (different name, different group number).,The issue numbers relate to the Python bug tracker, except where listed otherwise., or , matches horizontal whitespace and , or , matches vertical whitespace.,The test of a conditional pattern can be a lookaround.,This is not quite the same as putting a lookaround in the first branch of a pair of alternatives.,In the first example, the lookaround matched, but the remainder of the first branch failed to match, and so the second branch was attempted, whereas in the second example, the lookaround matched, and the first branch failed to match, but the second branch was , attempted.,The POSIX standard for regex is to return the leftmost longest match. This can be turned on using the , flag.,Note that it will take longer to find matches because when it finds a match at a certain position, it won't return that immediately, but will keep looking to see if there's another longer match there.,If there's no group called ""DEFINE"", then ... will be ignored except that any groups defined within it can be called and that the normal rules for numbering groups still apply., discards the backtracking info up to that point. When used in an atomic group or a lookaround, it won't affect the enclosing pattern., is similar to ,, except that it also sets where in the text the next attempt to match will start. When used in an atomic group or a lookaround, it won't affect the enclosing pattern., causes immediate backtracking. , is a permitted abbreviation.,Keeps the part of the entire match after the position where , occurred; the part before it is discarded.,It does not affect what groups return.,You can use subscripting to get the captures of a repeated group.,This is in addition to the existing ,.,The , flag is intended for legacy code and has limited support. You're still recommended to use Unicode instead.,A partial match is one that matches up to the end of string, but that string has been truncated and you want to know whether a complete match could be possible if the string had not been truncated.,Partial matches are supported by ,, ,, , and , with the , keyword argument.,Match objects have a , attribute, which is , if it's a partial match.,For example, if you wanted a user to enter a 4-digit number and check it character by character as it was being entered:,Sometimes it's not clear how zero-width matches should be handled. For example, should , match 0 characters directly after matching >0 characters?, is a combination of , and ,:, returns a dict of the named groups and the last capture of those groups., returns a list of all the captures of a group, returns a dict of the named groups and lists of all the captures of those groups., returns a list of all the captures of all the groups., returns a list of all the spans of the all captures of all the groups.,Group names can be duplicated., behaves like ,, except that it must match all of the string., and , are alternatives to , and , respectively. When passed a replacement string, they treat it as a format string., is an alternative to ,. When passed a replacement string, it treats it as a format string.,A match object contains a reference to the string that was searched, via its , attribute. The , method will 'detach' that string, making it available for garbage collection, which might save valuable memory if that string is very large.,Recursive and repeated patterns are supported., or , tries to match the entire regex recursively. ,, ,, etc, try to match the relevant group., tries to match the named group.,The first two examples show how the subpattern within the group is reused, but is _not_ itself a group. In other words, , is equivalent to ,.,It's possible to backtrack into a recursed or repeated group.,You can't call a group if there is more than one group with that group name or group number (,).,The alternative forms , and , are also supported.,In version 1 behaviour, the regex module uses full case-folding when performing case-insensitive matches in Unicode.,In version 0 behaviour, it uses simple case-folding for backward compatibility with the re module.,Regex usually attempts an exact match, but sometimes an approximate, or ""fuzzy"", match is needed, for those cases where the text being searched may contain errors in the form of inserted, deleted or substituted characters.,A fuzzy regex specifies which types of errors are permitted, and, optionally, either the minimum and maximum or only the maximum permitted number of each type. (You cannot specify only a minimum.),The 3 types of error are:,In addition, ""e"" indicates any type of error.,The fuzziness of a regex item is specified between ""{"" and ""}"" after the item.,Examples:,If a certain type of error is specified, then any type not specified will , be permitted.,In the following examples I'll omit the item and write only the fuzziness:,It's also possible to state the costs of each type of error and the maximum permitted total cost.,Examples:,You can also use ""<"" instead of ""<="" if you want an exclusive minimum or maximum.,You can add a test to perform on a character that's substituted or inserted.,Examples:,By default, fuzzy matching searches for the first match that meets the given constraints. The , flag will cause it to attempt to improve the fit (i.e. reduce the number of errors) of the match that it has found.,The , flag will make it search for the best match instead.,Further examples to note:,In the first two examples there are perfect matches later in the string, but in neither case is it the first possible match.,The match object has an attribute , which gives the total number of substitutions, insertions and deletions.,The match object also has an attribute , which gives a tuple of the positions of the substitutions, insertions and deletions.,What this means is that if the matched part of the string had been:,it would've been an exact match.,However, there were insertions at positions 7 and 8:,and deletions at positions 10 and 11:,So the actual string was:,There are occasions where you may want to include a list (actually, a set) of options in a regex.,One way is to build the pattern like this:,but if the list is large, parsing the resulting regex can take considerable time, and care must also be taken that the strings are properly escaped and properly ordered, for example, ""cats"" before ""cat"".,The new alternative is to use a named list:,The order of the items is irrelevant, they are treated as a set. The named lists are available as the , attribute of the pattern object :,If there are any unused keyword arguments, , will be raised unless you tell it otherwise:, matches at the start of a word., matches at the end of a word.,Compare with ,, which matches at the start or end of a word.,Normally the only line separator is , (,), but if the , flag is turned on then the line separators are ,, ,, ,, , and ,, plus ,, , and , when working with Unicode.,This affects the regex dot ,, which, with the , flag turned off, matches any character except a line separator. It also affects the line anchors , and , (in multiline mode).,Set operators have been added, and a set , can include nested sets.,The operators, in order of increasing precedence, are:,Implicit union, ie, simple juxtaposition like in ,, has the highest precedence. Thus, , is the same as ,.,Examples:,regex.escape has an additional keyword parameter ,. When True, only 'special' regex characters, such as '?', are escaped.,regex.escape has an additional keyword parameter ,.

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,Simple yet flexible natural sorting in Python.,: Please see the , section for changes.,When you try to sort a list of strings that contain numbers, the normal python
sort algorithm sorts lexicographically, so you might not get the results that
you expect:,Notice that it has the order ('1', '10', '2') - this is because the list is
being sorted in lexicographical order, which sorts numbers like you would
letters (i.e. 'b', 'ba', 'c')., provides a function , that helps sort lists
""naturally"" (""naturally"" is rather ill-defined, but in general it means
sorting based on meaning and not computer code point).
Using , is simple:, identifies numbers anywhere in a string and sorts them
naturally. Below are some other things you can do with ,
(also see the , for a quick start guide, or the
, for complete details).,: , is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the
built-in , function. Like ,, ,
does not sort in-place. To sort a list and assign the output to the same
variable, you must explicitly assign the output to a variable:,Please see , for
an alternate way to sort in-place naturally., does not actually , version numbers.
It just so happens that the most common versioning schemes are designed to
work with standard natural sorting techniques; these schemes include
,, ,, ,. If your data
conforms to a scheme like this, then it will work out-of-the-box with
, (as of , version >= 4.0.0):,If you need to versions that use a more complicated scheme, please see
,.,Prior to , version 7.1.0, it was a common request to be able to
sort paths like Windows Explorer. As of , 7.1.0, the function
, has been added to provide users the ability to sort
in the order that their file browser might sort (e.g Windows Explorer on
Windows, Finder on MacOS, Dolphin/Nautilus/Thunar/etc. on Linux).,Output will be different depending on the operating system you are on.,For users , on Windows (e.g. MacOS/Linux) it is , recommended
to also install ,, which will help
, give results that match most file browsers. If this is not installed,
it will fall back on Python's built-in , module and will give good
results for most input, but will give poor results for special characters.,This is useful in scientific data analysis (and was the default behavior
of , for , version < 4.0.0). Use the ,
function:,This is where the non-numeric characters are also ordered based on their
meaning, not on their ordinal value, and a locale-dependent thousands
separator and decimal separator is accounted for in the number.
This can be achieved with the , function:,You may find you need to explicitly set the locale to get this to work
(as shown in the example). Please see , and the
, section below before using the , function.,If you need to combine multiple algorithm modifiers (such as ,,
,, and ,), you can combine the options using the
bitwise OR operator (,). For example,,All of the available customizations can be found in the documentation for
,.,You can also add your own custom transformation functions with the ,
argument. These can be used with , if you wish.,You can mix and match ,, ,, and , types when you sort:, does not officially support the , type, but
convenience functions are provided that help you decode to , first:,Under the hood, , works by generating a custom sorting
key using , and then passes that to the built-in
,. You can use the , function yourself to
generate a custom sorting key to sort in-place using the ,
method.,All of the algorithm customizations mentioned in the
, section can also be applied to
, through the , keyword option.,The best way to debug , is to generate a key using ,
with the same options being passed to ,. One can take a look at
exactly what is being done with their input using this key - it is highly
recommended to , for , to debug,
and also to review the , page for , , is
doing that to your data.,If you are trying to sort custom classes and running into trouble, please
take a look at ,. In short,
custom classes are not likely to be sorted correctly if one relies
on the behavior of , and the other rich comparison operators in
their custom class - it is better to use a , function with
,, or use the , key as part of your rich comparison
operator definition.,If you don't want to read ,,
here is a quick primer., provides a , that can be passed to ,
or , in order to modify the default sorting behavior. This key
is generated on-demand with the key generator ,.
, is essentially a wrapper for the following code:,Users can further customize , sorting behavior with the ,

section).,The key generated by , , returns a ,. It
does so in the following way (,):,Because a , is always returned, a , should not be common

, package

, will still run (efficiently) without the package, but if you need
to squeeze out that extra juice it is recommended you include this as a
dependency. , will not require (or check) that

multimedia framework!
,
This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from
1.22.0.

,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of
media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple
Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video
(non-linear editing) processing.
,
Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology 
transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a
simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

access to virtual machines in a seamless way so you can play videos, record
audio, share usb devices and share folders without complications.,SPICE could be divided into 4 different components: Protocol, Client, Server
and Guest. The protocol is the specification in the communication of the three
other components; A client such as remote-viewer is responsible to send data
and translate the data from the Virtual Machine (VM) so you can interact with it;
The SPICE server is the library used by the hypervisor in order to share the VM
under SPICE protocol; And finally, the Guest side is all the software that must
be running in the VM in order to make SPICE fully functional, such as the QXL
driver and SPICE VDAgent."

  Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an
  annotated context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or
  generalized LR (GLR) parser employing
  ,(1) parser tables.  As an
  experimental feature, Bison can also
  generate ,(1) or
  canonical LR(1) parser tables.  Once you are proficient with Bison,
  you can use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from
  those used in simple desk calculators to complex programming
  languages.
,
  Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc
  grammars ought to work with Bison with no change.  Anyone familiar
  with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little trouble.  You need
  to be fluent in C or C++ programming in order to use Bison.  Java is
  also supported as an experimental feature.

	,The purpose of the Team softdev Linux driver is to provide a mechanism to team multiple NICs (ports) into one logical one (teamdev) at L2 layer. The process is called ""channel bonding"", ""Ethernet bonding"", ""channel teaming"", ""link aggregation"", etc. This is already implemented in the Linux kernel by the bonding driver.,One thing to note is that Team softdev Linux driver project does try to provide the similar functionality as the bonding driver, however architecturally it is quite different from bonding driver. Team softdev Linux driver is modular, userspace driven, very lean and efficient, and it does have some distinct advantages over bonding. The way Team is configured differs dramatically from the way bonding is.,
Note that there is no performance overhead added with the fact that the control logic happens in userspace. Packets never leave kernel.

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,Many container runtime tools like ,, ,,
etc. focus on providing infrastructure for system administrators and
orchestration tools (e.g. Kubernetes) to run containers.,These tools are not suitable to give to unprivileged users, because it
is trivial to turn such access into a fully privileged root shell
on the host.,There is an effort in the Linux kernel called
,
which attempts to allow unprivileged users to use container features.
While significant progress has been made, there are
, about it, and
it is not available to unprivileged users in several production distributions
such as CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian Jessie, etc.,See for example
,
which is a local root vulnerability introduced by userns.
, has some
more discussion.,Bubblewrap could be viewed as setuid implementation of a , of
user namespaces.  Emphasis on subset - specifically relevant to the
above CVE, bubblewrap does not allow control over iptables.,The original bubblewrap code existed before user namespaces - it inherits code from
,
which in turn distantly derives from
,.,The maintainers of this tool believe that it does not, even when used
in combination with typical software installed on that distribution,
allow privilege escalation.  It may increase the ability of a logged
in user to perform denial of service attacks, however.,In particular, bubblewrap uses , to turn off
setuid binaries, which is the , to get out of things
like chroots.,bubblewrap is a tool for constructing sandbox environments.
bubblewrap is not a complete, ready-made sandbox with a specific security
policy.,Some of bubblewrap's use-cases want a security boundary between the sandbox
and the real system; other use-cases want the ability to change the layout of
the filesystem for processes inside the sandbox, but do not aim to be a
security boundary.
As a result, the level of protection between the sandboxed processes and
the host system is entirely determined by the arguments passed to
bubblewrap.,Whatever program constructs the command-line arguments for bubblewrap
(often a larger framework like Flatpak, libgnome-desktop, sandwine
or an ad-hoc script) is responsible for defining its own security model,
and choosing appropriate bubblewrap command-line arguments to implement
that security model.,This program can be shared by all container tools which perform
non-root operation, such as:,We would also like to see this be available in Kubernetes/OpenShift
clusters.  Having the ability for unprivileged users to use container
features would make it significantly easier to do interactive
debugging scenarios and the like.,bubblewrap is available in the package repositories of the most Linux distributions
and can be installed from there.,If you need to build bubblewrap from source, you can do this with meson or autotools.,meson:,autotools:,bubblewrap works by creating a new, completely empty, mount
namespace where the root is on a tmpfs that is invisible from the
host, and will be automatically cleaned up when the last process
exits. You can then use commandline options to construct the root
filesystem and process environment and command to run in the
namespace.,There's a larger , in the
source code, but here's a trimmed down version which runs
a new shell reusing the host's ,.,This is an incomplete example, but useful for purposes of
illustration.  More often, rather than creating a container using the
host's filesystem tree, you want to target a chroot.  There, rather
than creating the symlink , in the tmpfs, you might
have already created it in the target rootfs.,The goal of bubblewrap is to run an application in a sandbox, where it
has restricted access to parts of the operating system or user data
such as the home directory.,bubblewrap always creates a new mount namespace, and the user can specify

Any such directories you specify mounted , by default, and can be made readonly.,Additionally you can use these kernel features:,User namespaces (,): This hides all but the current uid and gid from the
sandbox. You can also change what the value of uid/gid should be in the sandbox.,IPC namespaces (,): The sandbox will get its own copy of all the
different forms of IPCs, like SysV shared memory and semaphores.,PID namespaces (,): The sandbox will not see any processes outside the sandbox. Additionally, bubblewrap will run a trivial pid1 inside your container to handle the requirements of reaping children in the sandbox. This avoids what is known now as the ,.,Network namespaces (,): The sandbox will not see the network. Instead it will have its own network namespace with only a loopback device.,UTS namespace (,): The sandbox will have its own hostname.,Seccomp filters: You can pass in seccomp filters that limit which syscalls can be done in the sandbox.

is similar to Flatpak before bubblewrap was split out in that it combines
a setuid tool with a lot of desktop-specific sandboxing features.  For
example, Firejail knows about Pulseaudio, whereas bubblewrap does not.,The bubblewrap authors believe it's much easier to audit a small
setuid program, and keep features such as Pulseaudio filtering as an
unprivileged process, as now occurs in Flatpak.,Also, @cgwalters thinks trying to

is a bad idea given the myriad ways users have to manipulate paths,

system.  The bubblewrap approach is to only retain a few specific
Linux capabilities such as ,, but to always access the
filesystem as the invoking uid.  This entirely closes
, and
such., requires unprivileged user
namespaces to set up its sandbox, though it could easily be adapted
to operate in a setuid mode as well. @cgwalters believes their code is
fairly good, but it could still make sense to unify on bubblewrap.
However, @kentonv (of Sandstorm) feels that while this makes sense
in principle, the switching cost outweighs the practical benefits for
now. This decision could be re-evaluated in the future, but it is not
being actively pursued today., is currently working on
supporting ,,
without needing , or any other privileges during installation of
runC (using unprivileged user namespaces rather than ,),
creation, and management of containers. However, the standard mode of
using runC is similar to ,
in that it is tooling intended to be invoked by root.,The bubblewrap authors believe that runc and systemd-nspawn are not
designed to be made setuid, and are distant from supporting such a mode.
However with rootless containers, runC will be able to fulfill certain usecases
that bubblewrap supports (with the added benefit of being a standardised and
complete OCI runtime)., is just a wrapper for
runC, so inherits all of its design tradeoffs.,The name bubblewrap was chosen to convey that this
tool runs as the parent of the application (so wraps it in some sense) and creates
a protective layer (the sandbox) around it.,(Bubblewrap cat by ,),

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression and
decompression.,The supported formats are:,libdeflate is heavily optimized.  It is significantly faster than the zlib
library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
processors.  In addition, libdeflate provides optional high compression modes
that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's ""level 9"".,libdeflate itself is a library.  The following command-line programs which use
this library are also included:,, a program which can be a drop-in replacement for standard
, under some circumstances.  Note that , has some
limitations; it is provided for convenience and is , meant to be the
main use case of libdeflate.  It needs a lot of memory to process large files,
and it omits support for some infrequently-used options of GNU gzip.,, a test program that does round-trip compression and decompression
of the provided data, and measures the compression and decompression speed.
It can use libdeflate, zlib, or a combination of the two.,, a test program that checksums the provided data with Adler-32 or
CRC-32, and optionally measures the speed.  It can use libdeflate or zlib.,For the release notes, see the ,.,libdeflate uses ,.  It can be built just like any
other CMake project, e.g. with:,By default the following targets are built:,Besides the standard CMake build and installation options, there are some
libdeflate-specific build options.  See , for the list of these
options.  To set an option, add , to the , command.,Prebuilt Windows binaries can be downloaded from
,.,Although the official build system is CMake, care has been taken to keep the
library source files compilable directly, without a prerequisite configuration
step.  Therefore, it is also fine to just add the library source files directly
to your application, without using CMake.,You should compile both , and ,.  You don't need to worry
about excluding irrelevant architecture-specific code, as this is already
handled in the source files themselves using ,s.,It is strongly recommended to use either gcc or clang, and to use ,.,If you are doing a freestanding build with ,, you must add
, as well (matching what the , does).,libdeflate has a simple API that is not zlib-compatible.  You can create
compressors and decompressors and use them to compress or decompress buffers.
See libdeflate.h for details.,There is currently no support for streaming.  This has been considered, but it
always significantly increases complexity and slows down fast paths.
Unfortunately, at this point it remains a future TODO.  So: if your application
compresses data in ""chunks"", say, less than 1 MB in size, then libdeflate is a
great choice for you; that's what it's designed to do.  This is perfect for
certain use cases such as transparent filesystem compression.  But if your
application compresses large files as a single compressed stream, similarly to
the , program, then libdeflate isn't for you.,Note that with chunk-based compression, you generally should have the
uncompressed size of each chunk stored outside of the compressed data itself.
This enables you to allocate an output buffer of the correct size without
guessing.  However, libdeflate's decompression routines do optionally provide
the actual number of output bytes in case you need it.,Windows developers: note that the calling convention of libdeflate.dll is
""cdecl"".  (libdeflate v1.4 through v1.12 used ""stdcall"" instead.),The libdeflate project itself only provides a C library.  If you need to use
libdeflate from a programming language other than C or C++, consider using the
following bindings:,Note: these are third-party projects which haven't necessarily been vetted by
the authors of libdeflate.  Please direct all questions, bugs, and improvements
for these bindings to their authors.,The DEFLATE format (,), the zlib
format (,), and the gzip format
(,) are commonly confused with
each other as well as with the ,, which
actually supports all three formats.  libdeflate (this library) also supports
all three formats.,Briefly, DEFLATE is a raw compressed stream, whereas zlib and gzip are different
wrappers for this stream.  Both zlib and gzip include checksums, but gzip can
include extra information such as the original filename.  Generally, you should
choose a format as follows:,Note that gzip and zlib streams can be distinguished from each other based on
their starting bytes, but this is not necessarily true of raw DEFLATE streams.,An often-underappreciated fact of compression formats such as DEFLATE is that
there are an enormous number of different ways that a given input could be
compressed.  Different algorithms and different amounts of computation time will
result in different compression ratios, while remaining equally compatible with
the decompressor.,For this reason, the commonly used zlib library provides nine compression
levels.  Level 1 is the fastest but provides the worst compression; level 9
provides the best compression but is the slowest.  It defaults to level 6.
libdeflate uses this same design but is designed to improve on both zlib's
performance , compression ratio at every compression level.  In addition,
libdeflate's levels go , to make room for a
minimum-cost-path based algorithm (sometimes called ""optimal parsing"") that can
significantly improve on zlib's compression ratio.,If you are using DEFLATE (or zlib, or gzip) in your application, you should test
different levels to see which works best for your application.,Despite DEFLATE's widespread use mainly through the zlib library, in the
compression community this format from the early 1990s is often considered
obsolete.  And in a few significant ways, it is.,So why implement DEFLATE at all, instead of focusing entirely on
bzip2/LZMA/xz/LZ4/LZX/ZSTD/Brotli/LZHAM/LZFSE/[insert cool new format here]?,To do something better, you need to understand what came before.  And it turns
out that most ideas from DEFLATE are still relevant.  Many of the newer formats
share a similar structure as DEFLATE, with different tweaks.  The effects of
trivial but very useful tweaks, such as increasing the sliding window size, are
often confused with the effects of nontrivial but less useful tweaks.  And
actually, many of these formats are similar enough that common algorithms and
optimizations (e.g. those dealing with LZ77 matchfinding) can be reused.,In addition, comparing compressors fairly is difficult because the performance
of a compressor depends heavily on optimizations which are not intrinsic to the
compression format itself.  In this respect, the zlib library sometimes compares
poorly to certain newer code because zlib is not well optimized for modern
processors.  libdeflate addresses this by providing an optimized DEFLATE
implementation which can be used for benchmarking purposes.  And, of course,
real applications can use it as well.,libdeflate is ,.,I am not aware of any patents or patent applications relevant to libdeflate.,

,Contents,
, is a low-level configuration system.  Its main purpose is to provide a backend to , on platforms that don't already have configuration storage systems. ,
, is a simple key-based configuration system.  Keys exist in an unstructured database (but it is intended that keys that logically belong together are grouped together). ,Change notification is supported. ,Stacking of multiple configuration sources is supported.  Mandatory keys are supported. ,The stacking can be done at ""mount points"".  For example, the global system configuration can be mounted under /system/ inside of each user's configuration space.  A single configuration source may appear at multiple points in the hierarchy.  For example, in addition to stacking over the normal keys at /user/, the system default keys may also appear at /default/ for inspection and modification by a system policy configuration utility. , integration is planned so that a normal user may temporarily gain the ability to, for example, write to the keys under /system/ (or /default/).  This means that programs like the GDM configuration utility no longer have to be run as root. ,
,You can tweak parameters from , with , , ,
,Since a typical GNOME login consists of thousands of reads and ideally 0 writes, , is optimised for reads.  Typically, reading a key from dconf involves zero system calls and zero context switches.  This is achieved with a simple file format that doubles both as the storage format for data in , and as an IPC mechanism between the clients and the server. ,Avoiding round trips and context switches is nice in itself, but the real win comes from allowing the IO scheduler in the kernel to do a better job by saturating it with requests coming from all of the applications trying to read their keys (as opposed to a common configuration server serially requesting a single key at a time). ,Having all of the keys in a single compact binary format also avoids the intense fragmentation problems currently experienced by the tree-of-directories-of-xml-files approach. ,Writes are less optimised -- they traverse the bus and are handled by a ""writer"" -- a DBus service -- in the ordinary way.  Change notification is also handled by the writer.  The reason for having a bus service at all is that because getting the clients to synchronise on writing would be a nightmare. ,The writer service doesn't have to be activated until the first write operation is performed. ,The service is completely stateless and can come and go as it pleases.  The list of change notifications that an individual client is interested in is maintained by the bus daemon (as a dbus signal watch/match list). ,
,A system administrators , for dconf is available. ,
, , Note: Most applications will not want to interface directly with dconf, but rather with GSettings.,The dconf API is very simple and small.  It can be roughly divided into 4 categories: ,The read functions allow you to list the contents of the database, to read values, and to query the writability of a particular portion of the database (ie: according to system policy).  Due to the database being mapped into each process's address space, these calls are synchronous and non-blocking. ,The write functions allow you to set keys (including atomic multi-key writes), to reset keys and to apply locks (ie: policy).  These calls all exist in two flavours: blocking synchronous versions and non-blocking asynchronous versions with an API style similar to that used in GIO. ,The watching functions allow you to express interest in modifications to certain portions of the tree (or single keys). ,
,Since version 0.2, dconf is licensed under the LGPL version 2.1 ""or later"". ,

  ,The goal of the decorator module is to make it easy to define
signature-preserving function decorators and decorator factories.
It also includes an implementation of multiple dispatch and other niceties
(please check the docs). It is released under a two-clauses
BSD license, i.e. basically you can do whatever you want with it but I am not
responsible.,If you are lazy, just perform,which will install just the module on your system.,If you prefer to install the full distribution from source, including
the documentation, clone the , or download the ,, unpack it and run,in the main directory, possibly as superuser.,If you have the source code installation you can run the tests with,or (if you have setuptools installed),Notice that you may run into trouble if in your system there
is an older version of the decorator module; in such a case remove the
old version. It is safe even to copy the module , over
an existing one, since we kept backward-compatibility for a long time.,The project is hosted on GitHub. You can look at the source here:,The documentation has been moved to ,From there you can get a PDF version by simply using the print
functionality of your browser.,Here is the documentation for previous versions of the module:,

      ,Posted on Di 01 Juli 2008,Last weekend I set myself the task to write an , (i.e. hard
disk health monitoring) reader and parser.  After spending some time reading
all kinds of , and , docs and a bit of hacking I now present
you the following new software:, You might ask what the point of all this stuff is where
, already
exists.  What I'd like to see on future GNOME desktops is that as soon as a
disk starts to fail a notification bubble pops up warning the user about this
fact, and suggesting that he makes backups and replaces the disk. For a tight
integration into the desktop, a S.M.A.R.T. implementation that is small, and not
C++, and a library (i.e. embeddable into other software with a sane interface)
is highly preferable. Also, stuff like distribution installers should link
against , to warn the user about old, and defective disks
before he even starts the installation on them. (Hey, anaconda developers! That means you! It's a tiny library, and all you need to do is a single call: ,),Please note that I certainly don't plan to replace ,.
, will always implement only a subset of S.M.A.R.T. If you want
the full set of functionality then please refer to ,., I plan to fully maintain ,
(including , and ,) for the future. However
, and , will probably just bitrot in my repository
-- unless someone else wants to pick this up and maintain it.  The reason my
further interest in those tools is rather limited is that for the long run we
will hopefully will see davidz's , (,)
changed to use this library for health monitoring. Then DK-d will export the
S.M.A.R.T. info on the bus, and a separate daemon would not be necessary anymore.
DK-d provides a single interface for all kinds of health parameters for
storage, including RAID health and suchlike. I thus think this is the way
forward and not g-d-h-s. (That should, of course, not hinder anyone to step up
and take up maintainership of g-d-h/g-d-h-s if he wants to. There might be good
reasons for doing so. Maybe because you need something to do, or because you
want a S.M.A.R.T. solution for the desktop now, and not wait until DeviceKit gets
pushed into all the distros).,So, here's where you can get this stuff:,I will roll a 0.1 tarball of , soon. I'd be thankful if people could run
, on their disks and check if its output is basically the same as
,'s. Especially people with BE machines.,Of course the most important part of a software announcement is always the screenshot:,Category: ,

ruby-rake,"RAKE – Ruby Make,Other stuff,Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are specified in standard Ruby syntax.,Rake has the following features:,Rakefiles (rake’s version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?),Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.,Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.,Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths.,A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example, tasks for building tarballs. (Formerly tasks for building RDoc, Gems, and publishing to FTP were included in rake but they’re now available in RDoc, RubyGems, and rake-contrib respectively.),Supports parallel execution of tasks.,Download and install rake with the following.,First, you must write a “Rakefile” file which contains the build rules. Here’s a simple example:,This Rakefile has two tasks:,A task named “test”, which – upon invocation – will run a unit test file in Ruby.,A task named “default”. This task does nothing by itself, but it has exactly one dependency, namely the “test” task. Invoking the “default” task will cause Rake to invoke the “test” task as well.,Running the “rake” command without any options will cause it to run the “default” task in the Rakefile:,Type “rake –help” for all available options.,The original ,Rake ,Avdi Grimm’s rake series:,Martin Fowler’s article on Rake: ,Rake is a late entry in the make replacement field.

,Last modified on March 9th 2019.,If you experience problems with this web site, you have alternatives :

,
,
The , protocol is supported by most
home adsl/cable routers and Microsoft Windows 2K/XP.
The aim of the MiniUPnP project is
to bring a free software solution to support the ""Internet Gateway Device""
part of the protocol.
The MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol
(,) is also becoming very
popular but here we are talking about IGD.
,
(formely known as MiniDLNA) is a UPnP Media Server
using some UPnP code from MiniUPnPd.
,
,, now superseded by ,,
seemed too heavy for me. I want the simplest library possible,
with the smallest footprint and no dependencies
to other libraries such as XML parsers or
HTTP implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C.
,
Compiled on a x86 PC, the miniupnp client library has
less than 50KB code size.,
The miniUPnP daemon is much smaller than any other IGD daemon
and is ideal for using on low memory devices for this reason.
It also uses only ONE process and no additional thread, does not
use any , or , call,
and therefore keeps system resources usage
very low.
,
The project is divided in two main parts :
,
MiniUPnPd was first developped
on , 3.0+ with pf.
You can see some of the work I have done to 
integrate with pf on ,
(obsolete).
,
As pf is also available under ,,
guys at the , project
have ported miniupnpd to this system. Now it must be possible
to compile and run on every platform where pf is available.,
The daemon is now also available for linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x using
,. It is possible to make it
run on router devices running ,.
,
, worked on an
, (ipf) implementation.
I'm afraid it is not maintained...
Darren also added support for Solaris/OpenSolaris.
The ipfw port is available for MacOS X. It should be possible to make
it work on FreeBSD too, but I haven't received any feedback about that.
,
For some reasons, it may be not the good solution for you to use
the code from the MiniUPnP project directly.,
As the code is small and simple to understand, it is a good base
to take inspiration for your own UPnP implementation.
The , 
UPnP plugin in C++ is a good example.
,
If you are wondering which home router is working with the MiniUPnP client,
you can find the answer ,. In fact,
you are more likely to help me fill the list by sending me an email :)
,
The usage of the MiniUPnP client library is useful
whenever an application needs to listen for incoming connections.,
Examples : P2P applications, FTP clients for active mode,
IRC (for DCC) or IM applications, network games, any server software.
,
The typical usage of UPnP IGD capabilities of a router is a file
tranfert using MSN messenger. The MSN Messenger software
uses the UPnP API of Windows XP to open port for incoming connection.
To mimic the MS software, it is a good idea to use UPnP as well.
,I have made a ,
to show how the miniupnp client library can be used by an application.,,
a free software BitTorrent client is using miniupnpc and libnatpmp.,UPnP and , are used to improve
internet connectivity for
devices behind a NAT router. Any peer to peer network application
such as games, IM, etc. can benefit from a NAT router supporting
UPnP and/or NAT-PMP.
,
,The latest generation Microsoft XBOX 360 and Sony Playstation 3
game machines use UPnP commands to enable
the online play with the XBOX Live service and the Playstation Network.
It has been reported that MiniUPnPd is correctly working with the two
consoles. It may need a fine configuration tuning though.
Look for discussions on the subject in the
,.,UPnP implementations are potentially subject to security breaches.
Badly implemented or configured UPnP IGDs are vulnerable.
Security researcher HD Moore did a good work to reveal vulnerabilities 
in existing implementations : ,.
A common problem is to let SSDP or HTTP/SOAP ports open to the internet :
they should be only reachable from the LAN.
,In the past, several vulnerabilities have been found in MiniUPnPd,
so it is very important to update your code to the last version.,
It is now available ,.
,You can download the source code on the ,
or retreive the sources on ,.,
If you get any issue or would like some feature to be implemented,

                  ,Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use. We've set the
                     defaults to just work and it only takes a few clicks to configure advanced features like watch
                     directories, bad peer blocklists, and the web interface. When Ubuntu chose Transmission as its
                     default BitTorrent client, one of the most-cited reasons was its easy learning curve., ,   Transmission on macOS is a truly native and
                     polished experience. This isn't some cross-platform app that treats macOS as an afterthought. With
                     a sleek and simple interface, Transmission meets or exceeds Apple UI standards while using native
                     features.
                     ,v4.0 is Apple Silicon Native!
                  , ,   The
                     Qt-based Windows UI has been modernized and is fully Windows 11 ready. , ,   The GTK
                     interface has been carefully written to follow the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and features.
                  ,Transmission has one of the lowest memory & resource footprints of any major BitTorrent client. Transmission's light overhead is one reason why it is so well suited for home NAS and media servers. Having been used by Western Digital, Zyxel and Belkin, Transmission gives truly impressive performance on almost any compatible hardware.,Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike
                     some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn't play games with its users to make money., We don't bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter
                     tools, or anything else. It doesn't hold some features back for a payware version. We don't track
                     our users. Our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.,The features you want from
                     a BitTorrent client with an easy-to-use interface: privacy protection, a web interface, full peer

using ,. This behaves like fcron and enables you to e.g. define a job that
executes each 2nd Friday of a month by setting the days of month and the
weekday.,get_next calculates the next value according to the cron expression and
returns an object of type ,. , should be a , or a
, object.,Supported added for , method. (>= 0.2.0):,You can validate your crons using , class method. (>= 0.3.18):,Be sure to init your croniter instance with a TZ aware datetime for this to work!,Example using pytz:,Example using python_dateutil:,Example using python built in module:,Croniter is able to do second repetition crontabs form:,You can also note that this expression will repeat every second from the start datetime.:,Test for a match with (>=0.3.32):,For performance reasons, croniter limits the amount of CPU cycles spent attempting to find the next match.
Starting in v0.3.35, this behavior is configurable via the , parameter, and the default window has been increased from 1 year to 50 years.,The defaults should be fine for many use cases.
Applications that evaluate multiple cron expressions or handle cron expressions from untrusted sources or end-users should use this parameter.
Iterating over sparse cron expressions can result in increased CPU consumption or a raised , exception which indicates that croniter has given up attempting to find the next (or previous) match.
Explicitly specifying , provides a way to limit CPU utilization and simplifies the iterable interface by eliminating the need for ,.
The difference in the iterable interface is based on the reasoning that whenever , is explicitly agreed upon, there is no need for croniter to signal that it has given up; simply stopping the iteration is preferable.,This example matches 4 AM Friday, January 1st.
Since January 1st isn't often a Friday, there may be a few years between each occurrence.
Setting the limit to 15 years ensures all matches:,However, when only concerned with dates within the next 5 years, simply set , in the above example.
This will result in no matches found, but no additional cycles will be wasted on unwanted matches far in the future.,Find matches within a range using the , function.  This is much like the builtin , function, but for dates.  The step argument is a cron expression.
Added in (>=0.3.34),List the first Saturday of every month in 2019:,croniter supports Jenkins-style hashed expressions, using the ""H"" definition keyword and the required hash_id keyword argument.
Hashed expressions remain consistent, given the same hash_id, but different hash_ids will evaluate completely different to each other.
This allows, for example, for an even distribution of differently-named jobs without needing to manually spread them out.,Random ""R"" definition keywords are supported, and remain consistent only within their croniter() instance.,Vixie cron-style ""@"" keyword expressions are supported.
What they evaluate to depends on whether you supply hash_id: no hash_id corresponds to Vixie cron definitions (exact times, minute resolution), while with hash_id corresponds to Jenkins definitions (hashed within the period, second resolution).,We use zest.fullreleaser, a great release infrastructure.,Do and follow these instructions,Thanks to all who have contributed to this project!

includes fixes/improvements for several issues in the daemon-exclude code.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 3.0.0 is finally here!  This is a feature release that
also includes quite a few bug fixes.

,The 3.0.0 version number is such a large bump up from 2.6.9 due to the
addition of an
incremental recursion scan (which helps a lot with large transfers) and the
official arrival of several other new features, including ACL support, extended
attribute support, filename character-set conversion, etc.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.9 has been released.  This is primarily a bug-fix
release with a few minor new features.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.8 has been released.  This is a bug-fix release that
primarily addresses an exclude problem that affected the --relative option,
but also includes a , for
the xattrs.diff patch (which is not an
official part of rsync, but some packagers include it in their release).

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.7 has been released.  This release has both several new
features and the usual accompaniment of bug fixes.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.6 has been released.  This release is a bug-fix release
which contains a ,
to handle a null-pointer bug that turned up in rsync's version of zlib
1.1.4 (this is not the recent zlib 1.2.2 security fix, which did not
affect rsync) and to squash a few other minor bugs.  To deal with the
zlib issue, rsync has been upgraded to include zlib 1.2.3.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.5 has been released.  This release is primarily a bug-fix
release to squash some annoying problems that made it into the (feature-filled)
release of 2.6.4, plus a few minor enhancements.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.4 has been released.  This release combines quite a
few new features, some improved delete efficiency, and the usual array of
bug fixes.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.3 has been released.  It contains several new features
and quite a few bug fixes, including a , for a patch-sanitizing bug in the daemon code.

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.2 has been released.  It is a bug-fix release that mainly
fixes ,
that could cause files to be transferred incorrectly.  This only affected a
source right at the root of the filesystem, such as ""/"" or ""/*"" (if you
first ""cd /"" and then copy from ""."", it would not tickle the bug).

,See the ,
for a detailed changelog.

,Rsync version 2.6.1 has been released.  It is primarily a performance
release that requires less memory to run, makes fewer write calls to the socket
(lowering the system CPU time), does less string copying (lowering the user CPU
time), and also reduces the amount of data that is transmitted over the wire.
There have also been quite a few bug fixes, including a
, for a daemon problem when chroot
is not enabled.  See the
,
for a detailed changelog.

,The problem with rsync hanging at the end of the transfer on
, had been previously traced to a
signal-handling bug in their compatibility DLL.  This bug appears to now be
fixed in DLL version 1.5.7-1, and Cygwin users are reporting that upgrading the
DLL removes the hang-at-end-of-transfer problem for their existing rsync executable.
(Note that this doesn't solve a hang that some folks see in the middle of a
transfer -- using daemon mode instead of ssh can work around that one.)

, Two important things to note in the new release:

,One other item of note is that the oft-requested option ""--files-from"" is now
available.  This option lets you specify a list of files to transfer, and can
be much more efficient than a recursive descent using include/exclude
statements (if you know in advance what files you want to transfer).  The list
of files can come from either side of the connection, so it is possible for a
server to provide the file-list that lets someone grab a server-specified set of
files, for example.  See the ,
for more details.

yarn,"
      Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.
    ,
        Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. It also
parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are
faster than ever.

      ,
        Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package
before its code is executed.

      ,
        Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic algorithm
for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked on one
system will work exactly the same way on any other system.

      ,
      What are you waiting for?
    ,If you've installed a package before, you can install it again without
any internet connection.
,The same dependencies will be installed the same exact way across every
machine regardless of install order.

bluez-libs,"Official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack,Since version 0.3.59, PipeWire supports LE Audio’s Basic Audio Profile (BAP) for Connected Isochronous Streams (CIS) with the Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3), see ,.,Thanks to the modular architecture of PipeWire, it is ready for future codecs.,
It supports bi-directional audio and can act as a Central or Peripheral device. In the former case, it allows the end-user to select a new audio profile, while in the latter, it automatically connects Bluetooth audio streams to the local audio input and output. This paves the way for Auracast support in BlueZ and PipeWire.,If you are interested in trying this, the LC3 codec from , must be installed. The PipeWire meson build must be configured with the option `-Dbluez5-codec-lc3=enabled`.,From release 5.66, the initial support for BAP (Basic Audio Profile) which is an essential part of LE Audio responsible for stream control is added.,The plugin is considered experimental and depends on ISO socket in order to work so the following setting needs to be changed in order to enable it:,# Enables kernel experimental features, alternatively a list of UUIDs,
# can be given.,
# a6695ace-ee7f-4fb9-881a-5fac66c629af (BlueZ Experimental Offload Codecs),
# 6fbaf188-05e0-496a-9885-d6ddfdb4e03e (BlueZ Experimental ISO socket),
# Defaults to false.,
KernelExperimental = 6fbaf188-05e0-496a-9885-d6ddfdb4e03e,
,While proper support to the likes of PulseAudio and Pipewire are still in progress it is possible to test using bluetoothctl with the following commands:,

For MESH, new MGMT opcodes are added to share one controller between the legacy bluetooth daemon and the mesh daemon. This release also includes various bug fixes in A2DP, GATT, HOG,This release includes many changes related to the IOS support such as supporting ISO socket via experimental feature support and updating the monitor and tools. It also contains numerous bug fixes on A2DP, AVRCP, SDP, HOG, GATT, and MESH.,This is another release mostly with the bug fixes on HOG, GATT, A2DP, Media, AVDTP, AVRCP, and scanning failure. Also, this release includes a fix for building with old glibc (< 2.25), and other minor issues found with the static code analyzing tool. ISO packet support is added to the emulator as a part of LE Audio development.,This release is mostly a bug fix release, with fixes to features such as GATT, SDP, Daemon, and emulator. It also adds a new MGMT Event for Device Found and Device Lost of Advertisement Monitor.,New build options for sanitizers (lsan, asan, ubsan) are added and it may require installing additional libraries depending on the distros.,The Bluetooth SIG provides the self-study guide for Linux developers to explain the Bluetooth applications on Linux that uses D-Bus and BlueZ stack:,Please go to the , page to find more details and download the study guide package.,This release updates the sources to use the inclusive language based on the guide from the Bluetooth SIG(,), updates the DBUS API to add new properties for GATT and Adapter. For MESH, it updates the configuration client and adds a new API to export the keys. It adds a new document to describe the errors of D-BUS method returns for connection failure reasons. In addition, it includes the various bug fixes in Core, ATT, AVCTP, AVDTP, and MGMT API.,It recommends using the ELL version 0.44."

giflib,"The GIFLIB project maintains the giflib service library, which has
been pulling images out of GIFs since 1989. It is deployed everywhere
you can think of and some places you probably can't - graphics
applications and web browsers on multiple operating systems, game
consoles, smartphones, and likely your ATM too.,Yes, this code is he reason GIFs were in Mosaic, the first web
browser that could do inline graphics; it is the implementation
Andreesen and Bina used.,This is very mature, stable, small-footprint code with minimal
dependencies (suitable for use in embedded deployments) that needs only
occasional very minor bugfixes. Test reports from odd platforms and
better regression tests are particularly welcome. Don't try to
redesign it, applications beyond counting would break if you did.,It's ""GIFLIB"" in caps as a nod to the code's origins in the dark
and backward abysm of MS-DOS, but Unix hackers are encouraged to spell it 
""giflib"" in deference to local conventions. :-)

,Before October 2006 the GIF format was encumbered by patents on the
LZW compression it uses.  This first became an issue in 1993 when the
patent-holders made ambiguous noises about requiring royalties.  For
some time a subset of this code travelled as ""libungif"", supporting
decompression but not compression. You can read a more detailed
history ,.,Note: The 5.x versions change the API slightly in a way that isn't
compatible with older shared libraries.  This was required to fix 
some known problems with the extensions API and with thread-safety.,If you require shared-library compatibility back to ancient

almost identical; the few differences are explained ,.

It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder., v1.9.3 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core (0.16 Bytes/cycle). It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core (0.71 Bytes/cycle). A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for compression ratio., v1.0.1 is a LZMA2 compression algorithm, 20% to 100% faster than normal LZMA2 at levels 5 and above, but with a slightly lower compression ratio. It uses a parallel buffered radix matchfinder and some optimizations from Zstandard. The codec uses much less additional memory per thread than standard LZMA2., v1.0.9 is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression., v1.5 is a modification of LZ4 which gives a better ratio at cost of slower compression and decompression., v1.0 is an efficient compressor with very fast decompression. It achieves compression ratio that is comparable to zip/zlib and zstd/brotli (at low and medium compression levels) at decompression speed of 1000 MB/s and faster., v1_0_stable1 is a lossless data compression codec written in C/C++ (specifically C++03), with a compression ratio similar to LZMA but with 1.5x-8x faster decompression speed.,If you want build 7za:,7zr:,or build 7z.so:, is a separate project.,

by default). This means if your program has any side effects that happen before , is called, those
side effects will happen every time the user presses , (although anything your program prints to stdout or
stderr will be suppressed). For this reason it's best to construct the argument parser and call
, as early as possible in your execution flow.,Performance,If the program takes a long time to get to the point where , is called, the tab completion
process will feel sluggish, and the user may lose confidence in it. So it's also important to minimize the startup time
of the program up to that point (for example, by deferring initialization or importing of large modules until after
parsing options).,You can specify custom completion functions for your options and arguments. Two styles are supported: callable and
readline-style. Callable completers are simpler. They are called with the following keyword arguments:,Completers can return their completions as a sequence (list) of strings or a mapping (dict) of strings to their
descriptions (zsh will display the descriptions as context help alongside completions). An example completer for names
of environment variables might look like this:,To specify a completer for an argument or option, set the , attribute of its associated action. An easy
way to do this at definition time is:,If you specify the , keyword for an argparse option or argument (and don't specify a completer), it will be
used for completions.,A completer that is initialized with a set of all possible choices of values for its action might look like this:,The following two ways to specify a static set of choices are equivalent for completion purposes:,Note that if you use the , option, argparse will show
all these choices in the , output by default. To prevent this, set
, (like ,).,The following , uses
, and , to query GitHub for publicly known members of an
organization and complete their names, then prints the member description:, like this:,If you have a useful completer to add to the ,, send a pull request!,The , module defines a completer protocol in ,. Readline-style completers are also supported by
argcomplete, so you can use the same completer object both in an interactive readline-powered shell and on the command
line. For example, you can use the readline-style completer provided by , to get introspective completions like
you would get in the IPython shell:, can also be used to plug in an argparse parser as a readline completer.,Normal stdout/stderr output is suspended when argcomplete runs. Sometimes, though, when the user presses ,, it's
appropriate to print information about why completions generation failed. To do this, use ,:,By default, argcomplete validates your completions by checking if they start with the prefix given to the completer. You
can override this validation check by supplying the , keyword to ,:,In global completion mode, you don't have to register each argcomplete-capable executable separately. Instead, the shell
will look for the string , in the first 1024 bytes of any executable that it's running
completion for, and if it's found, follow the rest of the argcomplete protocol as described above.,Additionally, completion is activated for scripts run as , and ,.
This also works for alternate Python versions (e.g. , and ,), as long as that version of Python has
argcomplete installed.,Bash version compatibility,When using bash, global completion requires bash support for ,, which was introduced in bash 4.2. Since
Mac OS ships with an outdated version of Bash (3.2), you can either use zsh or install a newer version of bash using
, (, - you will also need to add , to
,, and run , to change your shell). You can check the version of the running copy of bash with
,.,Note,If you use setuptools/distribute , or , directives to package your module,
argcomplete will follow the wrapper scripts to their destination and look for , in the
destination code.,If you choose not to use global completion, or ship a completion module that depends on argcomplete, you must register
your script explicitly using ,. Standard completion module
registration roules apply: namely, the script name is passed directly to ,, meaning it is only tab completed
when invoked exactly as it was registered. In the above example, , must be on the path, and the user
must be attempting to complete it by that name. The above line alone would , allow you to complete
,, or ,.,The script , will try to install the global completion script
, (,) into an appropriate location on your system for both bash
and zsh (, and ,). On Linux, you will need to run the
script with sudo: ,, or run the script with , to see other options.,Argcomplete supports zsh. On top of plain completions like in bash, zsh allows you to see argparse help strings as
completion descriptions. All shellcode included with argcomplete is compatible with both bash and zsh, so the same
completer commands , and ,
work for zsh as well.,To register an argcomplete script for an arbitrary name, the , argument of the , script can be used:,This allows, for example, to use the auto completion functionality of argcomplete for an application not written in Python.
The command line interface of this program must be additionally implemented in a Python script with argparse and argcomplete and whenever the application is called the registered external argcomplete script is used for auto completion.,This option can also be used in combination with the other supported shells.,Argcomplete requires Python 3.7+.,Argcomplete maintainers provide support only for the bash and zsh shells on Linux and MacOS. For resources related to
other shells and platforms, please see the ,
directory.,If global completion is not completing your script, bash may have registered a default completion function:,You can fix this by restarting your shell, or by running ,.,Set the , variable in your shell to enable verbose debug output every time argcomplete runs. This will
disrupt the command line composition state of your terminal, but make it possible to see the internal state of the
completer if it encounters problems.,Inspired and informed by the , module by Martin Blais.,Please report bugs, issues, feature requests, etc. on ,.,Copyright 2012-2023, Andrey Kislyuk and argcomplete contributors. Licensed under the terms of the

,When you edit multiple md files remotely, like in a larger

by using colors.
And lastly, using such a thing for cli applications might improve user output,

a good option.,If markdown is often ""simple"" enough to be somewhat readable on 256 color terminals (except images that is).,from,You can also use mdv as a , viewer, best when you have docstrings with markdown in your code:,from,(the '_' after the docstring telling mdv that markdown follows),mdv is a proof of concept hack: While for simple structures it does its job quite well, for complex markdown you want to use other tools.
Especially for inlined html it simply fails.,The ones I know of (and which made me write mdv ;-) ):,Summary: For production ready robust markdown viewing (e.g. for your customers) I recommend nd still, due to the early state of mdv.

means that the ratio of input and output sample rates can be an irrational

down effects., provides a small set of converters to allow quality to be traded off

The main is ,, which acts as a filter, i.e. taking standard input, colourising it and writing to standard output., takes as a parameter the name of configuration file.,Directories ,, ,, , are searched for the file (in this order). If the file is not found, it is assumed to be an absolute path of a configuration file located elsewhere.,Configuration file consists of entries, one per regexp, entries are separated with lines with first character non-alphanumeric (except #). Lines beginning with # or empty lines are ignored.,Each entry consists of several lines.,Each line has form: ,where keyword is one of: regexp, colours, command, concat, skip, replace, count,Only regexp is mandatory, but it does not have much sense by itself unless you specify at least a colour, skip, replace or command keyword as well., is the regular expression to match., is the list of colours, separated by commas (you can specify only one colour), each colour per one regexp group specified in regexp.,if you use special colour name ""previous"", colour of the previous line of text will be used (actually, if both the first and last character of the previous line are of different colour than the default one, colour of the first one will be used).,Another special colour name ""unchanged"" will leave the colour unchanged, useful if you need some context for matching regular expression and you want to leave the colour of context unchanged.,Yet another special name is an arbitrary string enclosed in straight quotes. This string will be inserted directly into the output in front of the matching expression. The string will be eval'ed, so you can use usual python escape sequences.,This is useful on a 256-colour enabled xterm, where e.g.  , will give you a dark green (inspired by Rutger Ovidius).

operations. Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must
run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a
dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices algorithms have been moved
to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and
Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific
closed-source solution.,To address this problem the Linux media community is collaborating with the
industry to develop a camera stack that is open-source-friendly while still
protecting vendor core IP. libcamera was born out of that collaboration and
offers modern camera support to Linux-based systems, including traditional
Linux distributions, ChromeOS and Android.,04 February - ,In recent months, Jacopo has been pushing hard to get the Pine Phone Pro to have

,GNU Tar provides the ability to create tar archives,
as well as various other kinds of manipulation.
For example, you can use Tar on
previously created archives to extract files,
to store additional files,
or to update or list files which were already stored.
,
Initially, tar archives were used to
store files conveniently on magnetic tape.
The name ""Tar"" comes from this use;
it stands for ,ape ,chiver.
Despite the utility's name, Tar can direct its output to
available devices, files, or other programs (using pipes),
it can even access remote devices or files (as archives).

           device numbers during preparatory stage of an incremental dump.
           This allows to avoid creating full dumps if the device numbers
           change (e.g. when using an LVM snapshot).,The , option enables comparing device
           numbers. This is the default. This option is provided to undo the

           expressions, separated by a semicolon (as in ,).,Filename transformations are applied to symbolic link targets
           during both creation and extraction. Tar 1.19 used them only
           during extraction.,For a detailed description, see section
           ,.,The value of the blocking factor is made available to info and
           checkpoint scripts via environment variable TAR_BLOCKING_FACTOR.,Improved (sped up) extracting from incremental archives.,Previous versions always stored absolute file names in rename
           records, even if , was not used. This is fixed:
           rename records contain file names processed in accordance with
           the command line settings.,When supplied an archive smaller than 512 bytes in reading mode
           (,, ,), previous tar versions silently
           ignored it, exiting with code 0. It is fixed. Tar now issues the
           following diagnostic message: ,, and exits with code 2.,In addition to affecting regular archive members, the
           , option affects hard and symbolic link
           targets and the , option affects hard
           link targets as well.,See ,.,

gnome-autoar,"Google Summer of Code 2013 Final Report,
,
,Creating and extracting archives is easy, safe, and automatic. One module is created (gnome-autoar) and three modules are modified (Epiphany, Evolution, Empathy). The two major steps of this project are: ,An wrapper for ,, ,, and ,, provides GObject-based C API for archives and a few common widgets. ,
,Writing , is the first step. Although , provides nearly everything we need to create and extract an archive, we still need a wrapper for it to reduce duplicate code, store user preferences, and share common widgets. Many things are different between the API provided by , and gnome-autoar. , uses , for nearly all operations related to archives. Some operations which are not supported by GIO will use POSIX functions instead if they are available. , uses , to store user preferences. You can use one function to retrive user preferences and use one object to set preferences when creating and extracting archives. It use the ""org.gnome.desktop.archives"" schema ID by default, but you can change it. , will create exactly one directory or file when extracting an archive. No file will be created outside the output directory, so users do not have to worry about malicious archives because all absolute paths in the archives are converted to paths relative to the output directory. The name of the output directory or file is based on the name of the source archive. Even if you do not notify users about the output, users can easily figure it out themselves. , will prepend a common prefix directory to all paths in the archive if you want to archive more than one file or directory. Users who receive the archive created by gnome-autoar can safely use commands such as , to extract it. , redefines the format code and filter code which are defined by libarchive as consecutive positive integer. It is easier for applications to show all available options to users. Some formats and filters such as mtree and uuencode are omitted because they are not suitable for regular use. , provides functions for applications to check whether a file should be regarded as an archive. There are whitelists stored in ,. Package files such as rpm, deb, jar are not listed, so applications should know these files should not be extracted. , provides an archive format chooser which can be used by GTK+ applications. ,
,These applications will check whether a file is an archive before extracting. , ,: , will extract the downloaded file after the downloading is completed. It uses download panel to show the progress of extracting archive, and it is cancellable via the cancel button next to the item. ,: , use the status message bar to show the progress of creating archive, and it is cancellable via right click on the web page. A web page can only creating one archive at the same time because a , can only start a , at the same time. ,: , is currently a hard dependency of ,. , ,: , can save the original archive file and extracted files at the same time because the attachment is already loaded into memory. Users can choose what they want save, or save both the archive file and extracted files. It currently has no user interface to show or cancel the progress of extracting archive. ,: , can create an archive for a directory when attaching files. It is cancellable via right click on the item. ,: , is currently an optional dependency of ,. , ,: , can extract the archive file after completely received the file. It is cancellable via the stop button. ,: , can create an archive for a directory when sending a file. It will pop up a window and show the progress. It is cancellable via the cancel button on the popup window. ,: , is currently a hard dependency of ,. , ,
,Finally, this is a special summer for me! Although few things in my proposal still not completed, most things are completed and stable now. The code, result, and screenshot are available ,. ,TingweiLan/GSoC2013Final  (last edited 2013-12-14 13:11:53 by ,)"

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,Spiro is the creation of ,. It simplifies the drawing of beautiful curves.,LibSpiro is an adaptation of Spiro formula and functions into a sharable library ,.,Using Bézier splines an artist can easily draw curves with the same slope on either side of an on-curve point. Spiros, on the other hand, are based on clothoid splines which make it easy to maintain constant curvature as well as constant slope. Such curves will simply look nicer.,Raph Levien's spiro splines only use on-curve points and so are easier to use and more intuitive to the artist.,This library will take an array of spiro control points and convert them into a series of Bézier splines which can then be used in the myriad of ways the world has come to use Béziers.,Installing from Git master requires 2 preparatory steps:,First, you need to create the ./configure script if you do not have it yet,Second, you then use the usual steps to compile the library.
Various operating systems and setups will need ./configure options set.
The INSTALLATION file has detailed info for `configure' options.
Example install steps for Linux, FreeBSD, Win32/64 are shown below:,Installing on Linux,Installing on FreeBSD,Installing on Windows 32-bit,Installing on Windows 64-bit,NOTE: Some Distros and Operating Systems may require you to run 'ldconfig'
to recognize libspiro if you are not rebooting your computer first before
installing another program that depends on libspiro. To do this, you may
need to run 'ldconfig' in 'su -' mode after you have done 'make install':,FontForge will autodetect libspiro when it is installed in the usual way.,An exception to this is with the Mac bundled version (where , is copied to ,). To install your compiled version into the bundle, run ,Mac OS X: A helping script, , is provided to run FontForge inside a debugger to get useful information on solving crashes. An example issue is at ,A spiro control point contains a location and a point type. There are six basic types of spiro control points:,The left constraint, right constraint, anchor and handle points are easiest explained using
examples from path5 and path6 which are tested in tests/call-test5.c and tests/call-test6.c, ,There is a need to pass additional information to libspiro, and therefore the 'ncq' value was added.
'ncq' can be thought of as toggle switches telling libspiro how to work with the source spiro control points.
Below is the current toggle switch definitions, and default 'ncq' value is zero.,The definitions for ncq (above) are:,SPIRO_INCLUDE_LAST_KNOT:
Existing libspiro behaviour is to add a knot point to match each spiro point, but does not include the last knot.
This option includes the last knot with the existing output results while the spiro is still open. Closed spiros should refer to the first knot point since the last and first knot are the same.,SPIRO_INTERNAL_BEZCTX:
This provides a simpler interface for developers having trouble with the main libspiro interface.
With this method, two new functions are also provided and needed here.,File ""tests/call-test21.c"" has sample code showing how this can be done.,SPIRO_RETRO_VER1:
This newer version of libspiro (2019 and later) has modified the way path calculations are made.
The reason for this was seen as an advantage, because it allows a user to scale and move spiro paths, which is a common expectation in graphics, and there are other added advantages, such as making the path as part of templates, and more.
An effort was made to keep results as close to original as possible, but this was not possible due to scaling factors in the calculations.
As the main user for libspiro is FontForge, users such as font designers may see the least change since scaling targets x={0..1000}, y={0..1000}, while other users in graphics may see changes since they can be using scales much larger than 1000.
The good news here is 'SPIRO_RETRO_VER1' allows the user to toggle libspiro to use the older calculation method if the user needs backwards compatibility, otherwise, leaving this off allows spiros to use the new calculation method which allows scaling and moving spiro paths.
Older programs that use the older libspiro interfaces will see no-change since they use the older calculation method to maintain backwards compatibility.,SPIRO_REVERSE_SRC:
There may be a need to reverse the spiro path direction.
This option edits the source spiro path, and reverses the information, then proceeds to continue doing libspiro calculations with the reversed path.
When libspiro is done calculating bézier output, you will also have a reversed (input) spiro path, therefore save the new spiro path if you need it.
This simplifies this process for the calling program to a simple option 'SPIRO_REVERSE_SRC', and the results are up to date as per this version of libspiro.
NOTE - libspiro calculations are a one-way calculation, so you are not likely to see the same results in the reverse spiro path direction, but if you need this option, it is available here.,SPIRO_CUBIC_TO_BEZIER:
LibSpiro default action is to create cubic bézier curves.,SPIRO_CUBIC_MIN_MAYBE:
Cubic arcs can potentially be made with greater bends and less points.,SPIRO_ARC_MAYBE and SPIRO_ARC_MIN_MAYBE:
Instead of the default cubic output, this exposes the midpoint, which might be useful to someone.,SPIRO_QUAD0_TO_BEZIER:
Rough approximation of quadratic to bézier curves. Knot points will have smooth connection but midpoints may be visually okay or not.,You must create a super-class of this abstract type that handles the creation of your particular representation of bézier splines. As an , (cubic béziers). Spiro will convert a set of spiro_cps into a set of bézier curves. As it does so it will call the appropriate routine in your bézier context with this information – this should allow you to create your own internal representation of those curves.,Your program needs this Libspiro header file:,You must define a bézier context that is appropriate for your internal splines (See ,).,You must create an array of spiro control points:,Then call ,, a routine which takes 5 arguments and returns bc and an integer pass/fail flag.,Or call ,. This routine requires that the array of spiro control points be tagged according to Raph's internal conventions. A closed curve will have an extra control point attached to the end of it with a type of ,;,(The x,y location of this last SPIRO_END point is irrelevant).,An open curve will have the type of the first control point set to , and the last to ,.,(In an open contour the point types of the first and last control points are going to be ignored).,In this case there is no need to provide a point count nor an open/closed contour flag. That information can be obtained from the control points themselves. So , only takes 3 arguments and returns bc and an integer pass/fail flag.,An array of input spiros,A bézier results output context,Additional ncq control variable (default==0),An integer success flag. 1 = completed task and have valid bézier results, or  0 = unable to complete task, bézier results are invalid., I'm not proficient in Java., – this is an enumerated type which defines the same pointtypes used by the C interface: ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , – a Java interface used in conversion of an array of SpiroCPs to a Bézier contour., – a class with only static members:,

readline,"
The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in.  Both
Emacs and vi editing modes are available.  The Readline library includes
additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command
lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like
history expansion on previous commands.
,
The history facilities are also placed into a separate library, the
History library, as part of the build process.  The History library
may be used without Readline in applications which desire its
capabilities.

GTS stands for the GNU Triangulated Surface Library. It is an , , Library intended to provide a set of useful
functions to deal with 3D surfaces meshed with interconnected
triangles. The source code is available free of charge under the Free
Software ,.
,
The code is written entirely in C with an object-oriented approach
based mostly on the design of 
,. Careful attention is paid to
performance related issues as the initial goal of GTS is to provide a
simple and efficient library to scientists dealing with 3D
computational surface meshes.

As well as a number of bug and compilation fixes.
,
The interface to the gts_surface_refine() function has been made more
generic.

	,I consider this new release to be a major step forward with a new very robust implementation of boolean operations as well as several very interesting contributions from other people: marching tetrahedra for isosurface extraction (Gert Wollny) and differential geometry operators (Ray Jones) in particular. Thanks to all people who contributed, reported bugs etc... A summary of the most significant changes follows:
,
Boolean operations have been almost entirely rewritten and now use a
Simulation of Simplicity (SoS) technique to deal with degenerate
cases. This should fix most of the problems encountered when dealing
with ""simple"" geometric objects (i.e. cube/cube intersections with
coplanar faces etc...) Almost all the test cases in the test suite
(including significant tests submitted by users) now pass. Difficult
test cases like an object intersecting with a simplified version of
itself (created using coarsen for example) work fine despite the huge
number of degenerate cases (coincident and nearly coincident edges,
faces, vertices).
,
There is still a caveat however for intersections which creates
multiple closed loops contained within one another (note that this
was not a problem in the previous version). This needs to be fixed at
some point.
,
Another problem is that the surfaces resulting from a boolean
operation while guaranteed to be topologically consistent may contain
degenerate edges/faces which will prevent them from being used in a
subsequent boolean operation. The degenerate entities need first to be
eliminated (through edge/face collapse).
,
The gts_point_is_inside_surface() function has been rewritten using SoS.
,
A new stl2gts tool provides conversion between STL (stereolithography)
format and GTS format.
,
Ray Jones has added new functions to compute gaussian curvature,
principal curvature directions etc...
,
The gts_file_close() function call has been replaced by a
gts_file_destroy() function which does not close the file. This is
better left to the caller. Your application might need a slight
modification there.
,
The whole automake/autoconf stuff has been upgraded to use version
1.6.3 of automake.
,
Gert Wollny has added a marching tetrahedra isosurface construction
technique which should avoid topological defects in isosurfaces
(created by inconsistencies inherent to the marching cube technique).
,
A number of bugs have been fixed (thanks to bug reporters).

	,In this version, all the input functions are using a new structure
(GtsFile) which fixes the problem of reporting syntax errors when
reading input files. A detailed message describing the location (line,
column) and the type of error can now be easily set. All the read()
methods of the library classes now use this mechanism which gives far
clearer error reporting.
,
This comes at a cost however and a number of input functions
(gts_surface_read() etc...) have changed interface. Using the examples/
it should be easy to port your code though.
,
Other significant changes include:
,The initial version of gtsview, a simple viewer for GTS surfaces and progressive surfaces is ,. It demonstrates the use of progressive surfaces for level of detail visualization of triangulated surfaces.
	,Configuration and compilation have been cleaned and updated. Now builds both shared and static libraries.
,
A new ""gts-config"" script allows simpler use of the library (a la
glib), together with a gts.m4 macro definition for your own autoconf
usage.
,
A number of new features have been added:
,
A number of bug fixes and improvements have also been added:
,I finally found the time to clean up all the stuff I
wanted. Much has happened since 0.3.0. A new object structure inspired
by GTK allows to use classical inheritance mechanisms and virtual
functions. As a consequence the object hierarchy has been restructured
and now uses points, vertices, segments, edges, triangles, faces and
surfaces.
,
The Delaunay triangulation has been entirely re-written and is now
fully-dynamic (insertion or deletion of vertices). The constrained
Delaunay triangulation is semi-dynamic (insertion of vertices and
constraints).
,
Boolean operations between surfaces have also been re-written and are
more robust (and also benefit from a much more robust implementation
of the Delaunay triangulation).
,
Surface coarsening routines have been improved both in term of a more
generic interface and in order to avoid artefacts such as folds in the
simplified surface.
,
An interesting new extension is the implementation of progressive
surfaces which allow dynamic real-time continuous level-of-detail
representation of a surface. Progressive transmission of surfaces is
also possible. The first building blocks for a hierarchical surface
extension have been written. This will allow for dynamic
view-dependent simplification of surfaces.
,
The floating-point control interface necessary for robust geometric
predicates has been cleaned and GTS should now build on any (touch
wood) UNIX-based machine.
,
Preliminary support has been added for win32 compilation using
Microsoft C.
,
Please note that the html reference manual is now distributed with the
sources.
	,I am glad to announce that version 0.3.0 of GTS is available for ,. New features include isosurface computation from 3D functions and
the ""memoryless simplification"" algorithm of Lindstrom and Turk for mesh decimation (in the ,). The new , and , should give you an idea of what this is about. More to come soon.
,
The main API change you will have to deal with is that GTS now uses GSList instead of GList everywhere. It allows to save something like 30% of memory usage for a typical surface.
,
A few examples of how to use GTS are now included with the distribution.
,
New models are also available from the , page.

	,This section ""News"" is up and running! A new section , is also available. This is a collection of articles with links relevant to the design of GTS.
,
Due to popular demand, a new , directory has been created in the source tree. Only a few basic examples are available for the moment including: set operations on a pair of input files, volume computation, cleaning procedure for ""dirty"" input files and triangle decimation. These will be included in the next tarball release.

them addressed partially some simply don't care. However, having (partial)
solutions implemented in multiple places every time with a different set of

every other terminal emulator available. There is also a titlebar which will
update as shells/programs inside the terminal tell it to. Also on the titlebar
is a small button that opens the grouping menu. From here you can put terminals
into groups, which allows you to control multiple terminals simultaneously.,In April of 2020 we started moving , to GitHub.

gptfdisk,"not,Last Web page update: 4/18/2022, referencing GPT fdisk version 1.0.9,This Web page, and the associated software, is provided free of charge and with no annoying outside ads; however, I did take time to prepare it, and Web hosting does cost money. If you find GPT fdisk or this Web page useful, please consider making a small donation to help keep this site up and running. Thanks!,GPT fdisk (consisting of the ,, ,,
,, and , programs) is a set of text-mode
partitioning tools for Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Windows. The
,, ,, and , programs work on
Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) disks, rather than
on the older (and once more common) Master Boot Record (MBR)
partition tables. The , program repairs certain types of
damage to MBR disks and enables changing partition types from primary to
logical and vice-versa. You can learn more about , on , If
,, ,, and , sound interesting to
you, then read on (or skip straight to the ""Obtaining GPT fdisk"" link if
you don't need the GPT pep talk). If you don't know what a GPT is, be sure
to read the first section!, The FreeBSD version of GPT fdisk can't
normally save changes to your partition table if any partition from the
disk is mounted. If you want to modify your FreeBSD boot disk, the safest
way to do so is from an emergency system or from a dual boot to another OS.
Alternatively, you can type ,
at a shell prompt to enable FreeBSD to write to active disks. This
limitation is shared by at least some other FreeBSD partitioning tools,
such as , and FreeBSD's ,. This limitation does
, exist in the Linux, macOS, or Windows versions of the
software., MacOS 10.11
added a feature called System Integrity Protection (SIP), or less formally,
""rootless."" This system blocks access to certain critical aspects of the OS
and hardware by third-party programs, including GPT fdisk. Thus, GPT fdisk's
capabilities are limited under macOS 10.11 or later unless SIP is disabled.
Specifically, low-level access to the system disk is forbidden, so you
cannot repartition it. Access to USB flash drives remains possible, though.
Disabling SIP is covered on several Web sites, including ,
and ,
My , can
disable SIP, as described , Alternatively,
you can run GPT fdisk from a Linux emergency disk., BIOS-mode versions of Windows cannot boot
from a GPT disk; Windows can boot from such disks only if the computer uses
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware. Versions prior to
Vista may not be able to read GPT disks at all. Since GPT fdisk
automatically turns MBR disks into GPT disks, you should use GPT fdisk only
if you're positive your system can handle them. The vast majority of
computers sold with Windows 8 and later have UEFI firmware and so also use
GPT. Consult , for more information on GPT support in older versions of
Windows. (A , describes GPT with Windows 10 and later.) If you
have a BIOS-based computer and desperately need to boot from a GPT disk,
consult my , Web page; however, I have not tested these procedures in
years myself, and the , may work better today. Also, be aware that the vast majority of
computers sold since 2011 do , need to use such software,
since they support EFI-mode booting directly.,The Linux man pages for all of the GPT fdisk programs are available
here:,At least three Linux emergency systems ship with GPT fdisk. You can
create a bootable CD-R, boot it, and use GPT fdisk (and many other useful
Linux utilities) even on systems on which GPT fdisk doesn't compile. These
tools are also very useful for Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, Windows, and other
systems when things go wrong or when performing certain types of offline
maintenance.,The emergency disks I know of that include GPT fdisk are:,Some Linux installation media can also be used as emergency disks. The , installer, for instance, provides a ""try Ubuntu"" mode that is effectively a ""live CD"" similar to these recovery tools.,Note that GPT fdisk is a Linux text-mode tool, so you'll need to know
at least a minimal amount about using a Linux text-mode shell. Many basic
introductions are available on the Web.
You'll need to learn only enough to do very basic tasks; the , describes GPT fdisk
itself. Depending on your rescue CD and how you launched it, you may find
yourself at a text-mode shell when you first boot, or you may need to
locate an item called ""Terminal,"" ""Shell,"" ""xterm,"" or something similar to
start your text-mode shell.,copyright © 2009–2022 by Roderick W. Smith,If you have problems with or comments about this web page, please

True color / emoji works with new Windows Terminal, classic terminal is limited to 16 colors. Rich requires Python 3.7 or later.,Rich works with , with no additional configuration required.,Install with , or your favorite PyPI package manager.,Run the following to test Rich output on your terminal:,To effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the , method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function. Try this:,Rich can be installed in the Python REPL, so that any data structures will be pretty printed and highlighted.,For more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a , object.,The Console object has a , method which has an intentionally similar interface to the builtin , function. Here's an example of use:,As you might expect, this will print , to the terminal. Note that unlike the builtin , function, Rich will word-wrap your text to fit within the terminal width.,There are a few ways of adding color and style to your output. You can set a style for the entire output by adding a , keyword argument. Here's an example:,The output will be something like the following:,That's fine for styling a line of text at a time. For more finely grained styling, Rich renders a special markup which is similar in syntax to ,. Here's an example:,You can use a Console object to generate sophisticated output with minimal effort. See the , docs for details.,Rich has an , function which can produce a report on any Python object, such as class, instance, or builtin.,See the , for details.,Rich contains a number of builtin , you can use to create elegant output in your CLI and help you debug your code.,Click the following headings for details:,The Console object has a , method which has a similar interface to ,, but also renders a column for the current time and the file and line which made the call. By default Rich will do syntax highlighting for Python structures and for repr strings. If you log a collection (i.e. a dict or a list) Rich will pretty print it so that it fits in the available space. Here's an example of some of these features.,The above produces the following output:,Note the , argument, which outputs a table containing the local variables where the log method was called.,The log method could be used for logging to the terminal for long running applications such as servers, but is also a very nice debugging aid.,You can also use the builtin , to format and colorize output from Python's logging module. Here's an example of the output:,To insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons. Here's an example:,Please use this feature wisely.,Rich can render flexible , with unicode box characters. There is a large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc.,The animation above was generated with , in the examples directory.,Here's a simpler table example:,This produces the following output:,Note that console markup is rendered in the same way as , and ,. In fact, anything that is renderable by Rich may be included in the headers / rows (even other tables).,The , class is smart enough to resize columns to fit the available width of the terminal, wrapping text as required. Here's the same example, with the terminal made smaller than the table above:,Rich can render multiple flicker-free , bars to track long-running tasks.,For basic usage, wrap any sequence in the , function and iterate over the result. Here's an example:,It's not much harder to add multiple progress bars. Here's an example taken from the docs:,The columns may be configured to show any details you want. Built-in columns include percentage complete, file size, file speed, and time remaining. Here's another example showing a download in progress:,To try this out yourself, see , which can download multiple URLs simultaneously while displaying progress.,For situations where it is hard to calculate progress, you can use the , method which will display a 'spinner' animation and message. The animation won't prevent you from using the console as normal. Here's an example:,This generates the following output in the terminal.,The spinner animations were borrowed from ,. You can select a spinner by specifying the , parameter. Run the following command to see the available values:,The above command generates the following output in the terminal:,Rich can render a , with guide lines. A tree is ideal for displaying a file structure, or any other hierarchical data.,The labels of the tree can be simple text or anything else Rich can render. Run the following for a demonstration:,This generates the following output:,See the , example for a script that displays a tree view of any directory, similar to the linux , command.,Rich can render content in neat , with equal or optimal width. Here's a very basic clone of the (MacOS / Linux) , command which displays a directory listing in columns:,The following screenshot is the output from the , which displays data pulled from an API in columns:,Rich can render , and does a reasonable job of translating the formatting to the terminal.,To render markdown import the , class and construct it with a string containing markdown code. Then print it to the console. Here's an example:,This will produce output something like the following:,Rich uses the , library to implement ,. Usage is similar to rendering markdown; construct a , object and print it to the console. Here's an example:,This will produce the following output:,Rich can render , which are easier to read and show more code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.,Here's what it looks like on OSX (similar on Linux):,All Rich renderables make use of the ,, which you can also use to implement your own Rich content.,See also , for a command line application powered by Rich. Syntax highlight code, render markdown, display CSVs in tables, and more, directly from the command prompt.,See also Rich's sister project, ,, which you can use to build sophisticated User Interfaces in the terminal.,For some examples of projects using Rich, see the , on ,.,Would you like to add your own project to the gallery?

,Rasqal is used inside Redland to provide support for query
languages, a query API and a result bindings API over graphs stored
in indexed Redland triple stores.  Since this can index the triples

libb64,"
,
,
,
is a library of ANSI C routines for fast encoding/decoding data into and
from a ,-encoded 
format. C++ wrappers are included, as well as the source
code for standalone encoding and decoding executables.
,
Base64 uses a subset of displayable ASCII characters, and is therefore a useful encoding for storing 
binary data in a text file, such as XML, or sending binary data over text-only
email.

I did this because I needed a , C++ implementation of base64
encoding and decoding,
without any licensing problems. Some implementations are released under
either the GNU/GPL, or a BSD-variant, which is not what I require.
Some decent ones are available in Java, but as mentioned, I need C++ code.
,
The available code is mostly slow as well, and complicated to understand, use
and maintain. Base64 encoding and decoding is ideally suited to be
implemented using co-routines, which make the code more compact, easier to
read, and easier to use.
,
Also, the chance to actually use a co-routine implementation in production C++
code is rare; I couldn't pass up the chance.
For more information on this technique, see ""Coroutines in C"", by Simon Tatham,
which can be found on-line here: 
,
and read the 
,
section at the bottom of this page.
,
So then, under which license do I release this code? On to the next section...
,
Download via the project page: 
,
The latest release is
,.
,
Access via CVS is also possible. Info here:
,
,
This work is released into the Public Domain.
,
It basically boils down to this: I put this work in the public domain, and you
can take it and do whatever you want with it. An example of this ""license"" is the Creative Commons Public Domain License, a
copy of which can be found in the LICENSE file in the distribution, 
and also on-line at
,
,
The code can be built using standard make and gcc tools in Linux
(and others such as MinGW and Cygwin), or using a Visual Studio solution.
,
Currently, no install-script is available, but since the library is static,
and the executable is standalone, this is not a big problem:
Simply copy the executable somewhere in your path. For usage of the ,
executable, see the next section,
,
section for more details.)
,
Unpack the tarball somewhere and change into the directory. Change into the
resulting , directory and run ,.
The results will be a static library in the , directory, and an 
executable file in the , directory. 
,
Not that I , doing it, but it is possible to build the code
using MS VCC++ Express 2010, using the base64.sln solution file in the 
, sub-directory. This will only build the 
base64 executable, putting it in the relevant build directory.
,
Running the , program with no parameters shows how to use it:
,
,
Some C++ wrappers are provided as well, so you don't have to get your hands
dirty. Encoding from standard input to standard output is as simple as
,
It is DAMN fast, if I may say so myself. The C code uses a little trick which
has been used to implement coroutines, of which one can say that this
implementation is an example.
,
(To see how the libb64 codebase compares with some other BASE64 implementations
available, see the BENCHMARKS file available in the source code)
,
The trick involves the fact that a switch-statement may legally cross into
sub-blocks. A very thorough and enlightening essay on co-routines in C, using
this method, can be found in the above mentioned ""Coroutines in C"", by Simon
Tatham: 
,
,
For example, an RLE decompressing routine, adapted from the article:
,
As can be seen from this example, a coroutine depends on a state variable,
which it sets directly before exiting (lines 14 and 119). The next time the
routine is entered, the switch moves control to the specific point directly
after the previous exit (lines 16 and 21).hands
,
(As an aside, in the mentioned article the combination of the top-level switch,
the various setting of the state, the return of a value, and the labeling of
the exit point is wrapped in #define macros, making the structure of the
routine even clearer. Read the article, it's worth it)
,
The obvious problem with any such routine is the static keyword.
Any static variables in a function spell doom for multi-threaded applications.
Also, in situations where this coroutine is used by more than one other
coroutines, the consistency may be... disturbed.
,
What is needed is a structure for storing these variables, which is passed to
the routine separately. This obviously breaks the modularity of the function,
since now the caller has to worry about and care for the internal state of the
routine (the callee). The obvious solution would be to wrap the state along 
with the function into an object in C++.
,
This allows for a fast, multi-thread-able implementation, which is safe to use
and easy to understand and maintain.
,
The base64 encoding and decoding functionality in this package is implemented
in exactly this way, providing both a high-speed high-maintenance C interface,
and a wrapped C++ which is low-maintenance and of comparable performance.

entry by its index. To help with this use case, the , method returns
the index of the added item, whether it was already in the set or not.,OrderedSets implement the union (,), intersection (,), and difference (,)
operators like sets do.,The , and , methods have been extended to accept any
iterable except a string, returning a list, to perform NumPy-like ""fancy
indexing"".,OrderedSet implements , and , so it can be pickled,
and implements the abstract base classes , and
,.,OrderedSet can be used as a generic collection type, similar to the collections
in the , module like List, Dict, and Set. For example, you can annotate
a variable as having the type , or ,.,An OrderedSet can be used as a bi-directional mapping between a sparse
vocabulary and dense index numbers. As of version 3.1, it accepts NumPy arrays
of index numbers as well as lists.,This combination of features makes OrderedSet a simple implementation of many
of the things that , is used for, and many of its operations are
faster than the equivalent pandas operations.,For further compatibility with pandas.Index, , (the pandas method for
looking up a single index) and , (the pandas method for fancy
indexing in reverse) are both aliases for , (which handles both cases
in OrderedSet).,OrderedSet was implemented by Elia Robyn Lake (maiden name: Robyn Speer).
Jon Crall contributed changes and tests to make it fit the Python set API.
Roman Inflianskas added the original type annotations.,The original implementation of OrderedSet was a , by Raymond Hettiger, released under the MIT license.,Hettiger's implementation kept its content in a doubly-linked list referenced by a
dict. As a result, looking up an item by its index was an O(N) operation, while
deletion was O(1).,This version makes different trade-offs for the sake of efficient lookups. Its
content is a standard Python list instead of a doubly-linked list. This
provides O(1) lookups by index at the expense of O(N) deletion, as well as
slightly faster iteration.,In Python 3.6 and later, the built-in , type is inherently ordered. If you
ignore the dictionary values, that also gives you a simple ordered set, with
fast O(1) insertion, deletion, iteration and membership testing. However, ,
does not provide the list-like random access features of OrderedSet. You
would have to convert it to a list in O(N) to look up the index of an entry or
look up an entry by its index.,

the dust.,Jconvolver is a command line JACK application using the zita-convolver
  library. Complex convolution matrices can be defined in a configuration
  file. The same configuration file can also be used by fconvolver which
  performs the same operation on files rather than real-time.,Jmatconvol is a command line JACK application similar to jconvolver,

,Libzita-convolver is a real-time C++ convolution library using FFT based
convolution with non-uniform partition sizes: small ones at the start
of the impulse response and building up to the most efficient size
further on. It can perform zero-delay processing of very long IRs (e.g.
reverbs) with moderate CPU load. The calculations are distributed over
up to five threads, one for each partition size, running at priorities
equal to or just below that of the calling thread. This ensures that
even when multiple instances are active at the same time, CPU resources
will be allocated in the optimum way.,Main features:
,
Libzita-resampler is a C++ library for resampling audio signals. It is designed
to be used within a real-time processing context, to be fast, and to provide
high-quality sample rate conversion.
,
The library operates on signals represented in single-precision floating point
format. For multichannel operation both the input and output signals are
assumed to be stored as interleaved samples.
,
The API allows a trade-off between quality and CPU load. For the latter
a range of approximately 1:6 is available. Even at the highest quality
setting libzita-resampler will be faster than most similar libraries, e.g.
libsamplerate.
,
The source distribution includes the , application.
Input format is any file readable by libsndfile, output is either
WAV (WAVEX for more than 2 channels) or CAF. Apart from resampling
you can change the sample format to 16-bit, 24-bit or float, and for
16-bit output, add dithering. Available dithering types are rectangular,
triangular, and Lipschitz' optimised error feedback filter. Some examples
of dithering can be seen ,
,
Libzita-alsa-pcmi is a C++ library for using ALSA audio devices
with minimal latency and using ALSA's memory-mapped mode (as used
by Jack). It hides most of the complexity of configuring and using
ALSA devices in this way., Input and output audio streams are converted to / from 32-bit
floating point format, regardless of the hardware sample format.
By calling the read and write functions from a real-time thread,
it is easy to provide a callback interface, and to write applications
that work with both ALSA and Jack using the same processing code.

gst-plugins-good,"News - GStreamer 1.22.1 stable bug fix release,What is GStreamer?,
The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first bug fix release in the
stable 1.22 release series of your favourite cross-platform
multimedia framework!
,
This release only contains bugfixes and it should be safe to update from
1.22.0.
,
  ,
  ,
See the ,
for more details.
,
Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be available shortly.
,
Release tarballs can be downloaded directly here:
,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of
media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple
Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video
(non-linear editing) processing.
,
Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology 
transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a
simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.
,
,
GStreamer is released under the LGPL. The 1.x series is API and ABI stable
and supersedes the previous stable 0.10 series. Both can be installed in
parallel.

external CLI commands via setuptools entry-points.,Lets say you develop a commandline interface and someone requests a new feature
that is absolutely related to your project but would have negative consequences
like additional dependencies, major refactoring, or maybe its just too domain
specific to be supported directly.  Rather than developing a separate standalone
utility you could offer up a ,
that allows others to use your commandline utility as a home for their related
sub-commands.  You get to choose where these sub-commands or sub-groups CAN be
registered but the plugin developer gets to choose they ARE registered.  You
could have all plugins register alongside the core commands, in a special
sub-group, across multiple sub-groups, or some combination.,For a more detailed example see the , section.,The only requirement is decorating , with ,
which handles attaching external commands and groups.  In this case the core CLI developer
registers CLI plugins from ,.,Plugin developers need to register their sub-commands or sub-groups to an
entry-point in their , that is loaded by the core package.,Any sub-command or sub-group that cannot be loaded is caught and converted to
a , rather than just crashing the entire
CLI.  The short-help is converted to a warning message like:,and if the sub-command or group is executed the entire traceback is printed.,Opening a CLI to plugins encourages other developers to independently extend
functionality independently but there is no guarantee these new features will
be ""on brand"".  Plugin developers are almost certainly already using features
in the core package the CLI belongs to so defining commonly used arguments and
options in one place lets plugin developers reuse these flags to produce a more
cohesive CLI.  If the CLI is simple maybe just define them at the top of
, or for more complex packages something like
,.  These common options need to be easy to find
and be well documented so that plugin developers know what variable to give to
their sub-command's function and what object they can expect to receive.  Don't
forget to document non-obvious callbacks.,Keep in mind that plugin developers also have access to the parent group's
,, which is very useful for passing things like verbosity levels or
config values around to sub-commands.,Here's some code that sub-commands could re-use:,Plugin developers can access this with:,With ,:,From source:,See ,See ,See ,

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current
directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules
and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable
all automatic filtering by default, use ,.) ripgrep has first class
support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads available for ,. ripgrep is similar to
other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.,

all matches must be words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel
i7-6900K 3.2 GHz.,Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my
,
for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.,Here's another benchmark on the same corpus as above that disregards gitignore
files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the
previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensure that they are
doing equivalent work:,And finally, a straight-up comparison between ripgrep, ugrep and GNU grep on a
single large file cached in memory
(~13GB, ,):,In the above benchmark, passing the , flag (for showing line numbers)
increases the times to , for ripgrep and , for GNU grep. ugrep
times are unaffected by the presence or absence of ,.,In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
bugs and Unicode support.,Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep,
over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file
searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple
lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and
backreference support.,At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one
or more of the following:,Generally, yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is

excellent table comparing the features of ack, ag, git-grep, GNU grep and

ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.65.0 (stable) or newer. In general, ripgrep tracks
the latest stable release of the Rust compiler.,To build ripgrep:,If you have a Rust nightly compiler and a recent Intel CPU, then you can enable
additional optional SIMD acceleration like so:,The , feature enables SIMD support in certain ripgrep dependencies
(responsible for transcoding). They are not necessary to get SIMD optimizations
for search; those are enabled automatically. Hopefully, some day, the
, feature will similarly become unnecessary. , Currently,
enabling this option can increase compilation times dramatically.,Finally, optional PCRE2 support can be built with ripgrep by enabling the
, feature:,(Tip: use , to also include compile time SIMD
optimizations, which will only work with a nightly compiler.),Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
attempt to automatically find and link with your system's PCRE2 library via
,. If one doesn't exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
using your system's C compiler and then statically link it into the final
executable. Static linking can be forced even when there is an available PCRE2
system library by either building ripgrep with the MUSL target or by setting
,.,ripgrep can be built with the MUSL target on Linux by first installing the MUSL
library on your system (consult your friendly neighborhood package manager).
Then you just need to add MUSL support to your Rust toolchain and rebuild
ripgrep, which yields a fully static executable:,Applying the , flag from above works as expected. If you want to
build a static executable with MUSL and with PCRE2, then you will need to have
, installed, which might be in a separate package from the actual
MUSL library, depending on your Linux distribution.,ripgrep is relatively well-tested, including both unit tests and integration
tests. To run the full test suite, use:,from the repository root.,For reporting a security vulnerability, please

designed to be portable. It consists of the following parts:,For more information see , is mostly feature complete. For now however it
includes backends only for ALSA, PulseAudio, OSS and GStreamer., has been
declared ,.,The OSS driver is incomplete: only sound files that are in a format
natively understood by the sound card are supported. If the sample
type, channel map or sampling rate of the sound file are not supported
by the sound card no automatic conversion will take place and the file
will not be played. Also note that the OSS backend is most likely
incompatible with OSS4, due to subtle incompatibilities between OSS4
and the OSS 3.x.,It is recommended to always take the ""shortest"" path from
libcanberra to the audio device. I.e. don't use the GStreamer plugin
if libcanberra supports the final output target natively. Besides
being more resource-friendly and less error-prone, some advanced
functionality might get lost with each layer you add to your
stack. For example: while you could use libcanberra's Gstreamer
backend to output to a PulseAudio server this will not be able to make
use of sample cacheing or will be able to attach additional meta data
to the sounds played, which might be necessary for effects like
positional event sounds.,You may browse the ,

Please refer to , for how to add or update
new dependencies.,Please note that runc is a low level tool not designed with an end user
in mind. It is mostly employed by other higher level container software.,Therefore, unless there is some specific use case that prevents the use
of tools like Docker or Podman, it is not recommended to use runc directly.,If you still want to use runc, here's how.,In order to use runc you must have your container in the format of an OCI bundle.
If you have Docker installed you can use its , method to acquire a root filesystem from an existing Docker container.,After a root filesystem is populated you just generate a spec in the format of a , file inside your bundle.
, provides a , command to generate a base template spec that you are then able to edit.
To find features and documentation for fields in the spec please refer to the , repository.,Assuming you have an OCI bundle from the previous step you can execute the container in two different ways.,The first way is to use the convenience command , that will handle creating, starting, and deleting the container after it exits.,If you used the unmodified , template this should give you a , session inside the container.,The second way to start a container is using the specs lifecycle operations.
This gives you more power over how the container is created and managed while it is running.

,This is the reference C implementation of Argon2, the password-hashing
function that won the ,.,Argon2 is a password-hashing function that summarizes the state of the
art in the design of memory-hard functions and can be used to hash
passwords for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.,It has a simple design aimed at the highest memory filling rate and
effective use of multiple computing units, while still providing defense
against tradeoff attacks (by exploiting the cache and memory organization
of the recent processors).,Argon2 has three variants: Argon2i, Argon2d, and Argon2id. Argon2d is faster
and uses data-depending memory access, which makes it highly resistant
against GPU cracking attacks and suitable for applications with no threats
from side-channel timing attacks (eg. cryptocurrencies). Argon2i instead
uses data-independent memory access, which is preferred for password
hashing and password-based key derivation, but it is slower as it makes
more passes over the memory to protect from tradeoff attacks. Argon2id is a
hybrid of Argon2i and Argon2d, using a combination of data-depending and
data-independent memory accesses, which gives some of Argon2i's resistance to
side-channel cache timing attacks and much of Argon2d's resistance to GPU
cracking attacks.,Argon2i, Argon2d, and Argon2id are parametrized by:,The , gives detailed specs and design

, as,For example, to hash ""password"" using ""somesalt"" as a salt and doing 2
iterations, consuming 64 MiB, using four parallel threads and an output hash
of 24 bytes, provides an API to both low-level and high-level functions
for using Argon2.,The example program below hashes the string ""password"" with Argon2i
using the high-level API and then using the low-level API. While the
high-level API takes the three cost parameters (time, memory, and
parallelism), the password input buffer, the salt input buffer, and the
output buffers, the low-level API takes in these and additional parameters
, as defined in ,.,There are many additional parameters, but we will highlight three of them here.,The , parameter, which is used for ,.
This allows a secret key to be input at hashing time (from some external
location) and be folded into the value of the hash. This means that even if
your salts and hashes are compromised, an attacker cannot brute-force to find
the password without the key.,The , parameter, which is used to fold any additional data into the hash
value. Functionally, this behaves almost exactly like the , or ,
parameters; the , parameter is folding into the value of the hash.
However, this parameter is used for different data. The , should be a
random string stored alongside your password. The , should be a random
key only usable at hashing time. The , is for any other data.,The , parameter, which determines which memory should be securely
erased. This is useful if you want to securely delete the , or ,
fields right after they are used. To do this set , to either
, or ,. To change how
internal memory is cleared, change the global flag
, (defaults to clearing internal memory).,Here the time cost , is set to 2 iterations, the
memory cost , is set to 2, kibibytes (64 mebibytes),
and parallelism is set to 1 (single-thread).,Compile for example as ,, if the program
below is named , and placed in the project's root directory.,To use Argon2d instead of Argon2i call , instead of

usbredir,"usbredir,usbredir is the name of a network protocol for sending USB device
traffic over a network connection. It is also the name of the software
package offering a parsing library, a usbredirhost library and several
utilities implementing this protocol.,The protocol is documented
,,
this document also explains what is meant with a usbhost and a usbguest.,usbredir was created for use with Spice, which is why it is hosted on
spice-space.org, but the protocol and the usbredirhost are completely
independent of spice, they could for example also be used to create a
vnc extension for redirecting USB devices over a vnc connection to a
qemu virtual machine.,The usbguest side is currently only implemented for qemu, and shipped as
part of qemu (enabling this in qemu requires the libusbredirparser
library to be available when building qemu).,usbredir supports USB device filtering configurable by a filter string,For redirection to work, the virtual machine must have a supported USB
controller. Qemu supports both USB2 and USB3, but at the time of
writing, USB3 has had less testing. For USB2 support, the guest must
have a EHCI controller and companion UHCI controller (companion UHCI is needed
in order to support also USB1.x devices). For USB3 support, an XHCI controller
is required.
It also needs to have Spice channels for USB redirection. The number of such
channels determine the number of USB devices that it's possible to redirect at
the same time.,More information about USB controllers in qemu could be found
,.,Virtual machines created with virt-manager should have a USB controller
by default. In the virtual machine details, select ""Controller USB"" in
the left pane. If you only need to support USB2 devices, make sure its
model is set to ""USB2"". For USB 3.0 support, select ""USB3"" for the
model type.,You can then click on ""Add Hardware"" and add ""USB Redirection"" items as the
number of USB devices you want to be able to redirect simultaneously.,The following libvirt XML will configure a guest with USB2 support and the
ability to redirect 3 devices simultaneously:,For USB3 support, the configuration can be simplified to:,The following qemu options will configure a guest with USB2 support and the

select which USB devices to redirect under the ""File->USB device selection"" menu
once the Spice connection is established. There are also various command line
redirection options which are described below and when running remote-viewer
with --help-spice.,To get USB redirection working on Windows clients, you need to install
,A filter is used to set blocking or autoconnect rules for USB devices. It
consists of one or more rules, where each rule has the form of:,Use -1 for class/vendor/product/version to accept any value.,And the rules themselves are concatenated like this:,A client's default auto-connect filter string is 0x03,-1,-1,-1,0|-1,-1,-1,-1,1,This filters out HID (class 0x03) USB devices from auto connect and auto
connects anything else. Note the explicit allow rule at the end, this is
necessary since by default all devices without a matching filter rule will not
auto-connect.,Set a string specifying a filter to determine which USB devices, when plugged

UnZip 6.0
,
,
,
,
,
UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in , format
(also called ""zipfiles"").  Although highly compatible both with
PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's
own , program, our primary objectives have
been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.

,
UnZip will list, test, or extract files from a , archive, commonly
found on MS-DOS systems. The default behavior (with no options) is to
extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all 
files from the specified zipfile.  A companion program, 
,, creates , archives; both programs are 
compatible with archives created by PKZIP and PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but 
in many cases the program options or default behaviors differ.  (For
example, UnZip recreates the stored directory structure by default; 
PKUNZIP unpacks all files in the current directory by default.)

For the UnZip 6.0 release, we want to give special credit to Myles Bennet,
who started the job of supporting ZIP64 extensions and Large-File (> 2GiB)
and provided a first (alpha-state) port.

,
,

,
,
The next major release will be version ,.

,
It is questionable whether there will ever be a , major
release, but on the off-chance that there is, it will probably be version
,, perhaps with a much-improved and unified DLL interface and
possibly better file system support for the MVS and VM/CMS ports, assuming
that doesn't happen sooner.  And then perhaps version , will be
released, with full filter support (that is, able to read and extract a
zipfile from standard input like fUnZip does now), but now we're really
dreaming.  While we're at it, though, a , or ,
graphical interface might be nice--but see the , for a pointer to
TkZip, which already exists (and has for a long time).

,
,

,
,
Ready-to-run binary versions of UnZip are available for numerous platforms
and operating systems, but for most systems, only older binaries are available.
The three primary CTAN sites (and their many mirrors) contain a snapshot of
these binaries, current as of roughly 2004 (i.e., UnZip 5.51 and Zip 2.3
timeframe):

Normal OpenSSH development produces a very small, secure, and easy to
maintain version for the OpenBSD project.
,
takes that pure version and adds portability code so that OpenSSH can
run on many other operating systems. (Unfortunately, in particular
since OpenSSH does authentication, it runs into a ,
of differences between Unix operating systems.)

,
The OpenSSH provided here is designed to run on the following Unix
operating systems:

,
The portable OpenSSH follows development of the official version, but
releases are not synchronized. Portable releases are marked with a 'p'
(e.g. 4.0p1). The official OpenBSD source will never use the 'p' suffix,
but will instead increment the version number when it hits 'stable
spots' in development.

,
The following files describe the development efforts of the OpenSSH
portability development team. The release files are signed with the PGP
public key contained in the file , on the ftp site. This key is also available through the
, and has a fingerprint
of 7168B983815A5EEF59A4ADFD2A3F414E736060BA.

Bleeding-edge nightly snapshots are available

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,A script to configure transparent encryption of sensitive files stored in a Git
repository. Files that you choose will be automatically encrypted when you
commit them, and automatically decrypted when you check them out. The process
will degrade gracefully, so even people without your encryption password can
safely commit changes to the repository's non-encrypted files.,transcrypt protects your data when it's pushed to remotes that you may not
directly control (e.g., GitHub, Dropbox clones, etc.), while still allowing you
to work normally on your local working copy. You can conveniently store things
like passwords and private keys within your repository and not have to share
them with your entire team or complicate your workflow.,transcrypt is in the same vein as existing projects like
, and
,, which follow Git's
documentation regarding the use of clean/smudge filters for encryption. In
comparison to those other projects, transcrypt makes substantial improvements in
the areas of usability and safety.,The , process on an unchanged file must be
deterministic for everything to work transparently. To do that, the same salt
must be used each time we encrypt the same file. Rather than use a static salt
common to all files, transcrypt first has OpenSSL generate an HMAC-SHA256
cryptographic hash-based message authentication code for each decrypted file
(keyed with a combination of the filename and transcrypt password), and then
uses the last 16 bytes of that HMAC for the file's unique salt. When the content
of the file changes, so does the salt. Since an
,,
this method of salt selection does not leak information about the original
contents, but is still deterministic.,The requirements to run transcrypt are minimal:,...and optionally:,You also need access to the , script itself. You can add it directly
to your repository, or just put it somewhere in your $PATH:,A number of packages are available for installing transcrypt directly on your
system via its native package manager. Some of these packages also include man
page documentation as well as shell auto-completion scripts.,...see the , for more details.,transcrypt will interactively prompt you for the required information, all you
have to do run the script within a Git repository:,If you already know the values you want to use, you can specify them directly
using the command line options. Run , for more details.,Once a repository has been configured with transcrypt, you can designate for
files to be encrypted by applying the ""crypt"" filter, diff, and merge to a
,
in the top-level ,
config. If that pattern matches a file in your repository, the file will be
transparently encrypted once you stage and commit it:,The , file should be committed and tracked along with everything
else in your repository so clones will be aware of what is encrypted. Make sure
you don't accidentally add a pattern that would encrypt this file :-),For your reference, if you find the above description confusing, you'll find
that this repository has been configured following these exact steps.,For convenience, transcrypt also adds a Git alias to allow you to list all of
the currently encrypted files in a repository:,Alternatively, you can use the , command line option:,You can also use this to verify your , patterns when designating
new files to be encrypted, as the alias will list pattern matches as long as
everything has been staged (via ,).,After committing things, but before you push to a remote repository, you can
validate that files are encrypted as expected by viewing them in their raw form:,The , in the above command must be relative to the , of
the repository. Alternatively, you can use the , command line option
and provide a path relative to your current directory:,If you have just cloned a repository containing files that are encrypted, you'll
want to configure transcrypt with the same cipher and password as the origin
repository. The owner of the origin repository can dump the credentials for you
by running the , command line option:,Once transcrypt has stored the matching credentials, it will force a checkout of
any exising encrypted files in order to decrypt them.,Periodically, you may want to change the encryption cipher or password used to
encrypt the files in your repository. You can do that easily with transcrypt's
rekey option:,As a warning, rekeying will remove your ability to see historical diffs of the
encrypted files in plain text. Changes made with the new key will still be
visible, and you can always see the historical diffs in encrypted form by
disabling the text conversion filters:,After rekeying, all clones of your repository should flush their transcrypt
credentials, fetch and merge the new encrypted files via Git, and then
re-configure transcrypt with the new credentials.,Completion scripts for both Bash and Zsh are included in the ,
directory.,The method of using filters to selectively encrypt/decrypt files does add some
overhead to Git by regularly forking OpenSSL processes and removing Git's
ability to efficiently cache file changes. That said, it's not too different
from tracking binary files, and when used as intended, transcrypt should not
noticeably impact performance. There are much better options if your goal is to
encrypt the entire repository.,Note that the configuration and encryption information is stored in plain text
within the repository's , file. This prevents them from being
transferred to remote clones, but they are not protected from inquisitive users
on your local machine.,For safety, you may prefer to only have the credentials stored when actually
updating encrypted files, and then flush them with , once
you're done (make sure you have the credentials backed up elsewhere!). This will
also revert any decrypted files back to their encrypted form in your local
working copy.,Last up, regarding the default cipher choice of ,...there aren't any
fantastic alternatives without pulling in outside dependencies. Ideally, we
would use an authenticated cipher mode like , by default, but
there are a couple of issues:,I'd like to support OS X out of the box, and unfortunately they are the
lowest common denominator when it comes to OpenSSL. For whatever reason, they
still include OpenSSL 0.9.8y rather than a newer release. Unfortunately,
GCM-based ciphers weren't added until OpenSSL 1.0.1 (back in early 2012).,Even with newer versions of OpenSSL, the authenticated cipher modes
,
when utilizing the command line ,.,I'm contemplating if transcrypt should append an HMAC to the ,
ciphertext to provide authentication, or if we should live with the
,
as a known limitation. Essentially, malicious comitters without the transcrypt
password could potentially manipulate the plaintext in limited ways (given that
the attacker knows the original plaintext). Honestly, I'm not sure if the added
complexity here would be worth it given transcrypt's use case.,Context names let you encrypt some files with different passwords for a
different audience, such as super-users. The 'default' context applies unless
you set a context name.,Add a context by reinitialising transcrypt with a context name then add a
pattern with crypt-<CONTEXT, in a ""super"" context:,transcrypt is provided under the terms of the

This may however be useful for experimenting with a custom mode of operation or dealing with encrypted blocks.,The block cipher requires exactly one block of data to encrypt or decrypt, and each block should be an array with each element an integer representation of a byte.,This seems to be a point of confusion for many people new to using encryption. You can think of the key as the ,. However, these algorithms require the , to be a specific length.,With AES, there are three possible key lengths, 16-bytes, 24-bytes or 32-bytes. When you create an AES object, the key size is automatically detected, so it is important to pass in a key of the correct length.,Often, you wish to provide a password of arbitrary length, for example, something easy to remember or write down. In these cases, you must come up with a way to transform the password into a key, of a specific length. A , (PBKDF) is an algorithm designed for this exact purpose.,Here is an example, using the popular (possibly obsolete?) , PBKDF:,The , PBKDF is intentionally slow, to make it more difficult to brute-force guess a password:,Another possibility, is to use a hashing function, such as SHA256 to hash the password, but this method may be vulnerable to ,, unless you use a ,.,There is a test case provided in , which does some basic performance testing (its primary purpose is moreso as a regression test).,Based on that test, in ,, this library is about 30x slower than , for CBC, ECB and OFB; about 80x slower for CFB; and 300x slower for CTR.,Based on that same test, in ,, this library is about 4x slower than , for CBC, ECB and OFB; about 12x slower for CFB; and 19x slower for CTR.,The PyCrypto documentation makes reference to the counter call being responsible for the speed problems of the counter (CTR) mode of operation, which is why they use a specially optimized counter. I will investigate this problem further in the future.,The short answer, ,The longer answer, is for my , library. I required a pure-Python AES implementation that supported 256-bit keys with the counter (CTR) mode of operation. After searching, I found several implementations, but all were missing CTR or only supported 128 bit keys. After all the work of learning AES inside and out to implement the library, it was only a marginal amount of extra work to library-ify a more general solution. So, ,E-mail me at , with any questions, suggestions, comments, et cetera.,Umm... Ok? :-),  - ,

  ,Your codespace will open once ready.,There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.,As a node module:,You can also just load the module for the function that you care about, if
you'd like to minimize your footprint.,As a command-line utility:,A ""version"" is described by the , specification found at
,.,A leading , or , character is stripped off and ignored.,A , is a set of , which specify versions
that satisfy the range.,A , is composed of an , and a ,.  The set
of primitive , is:,For example, the comparator , would match the versions
,, ,, ,, and ,, but not the versions ,
or ,.,Comparators can be joined by whitespace to form a ,,
which is satisfied by the , of all of the comparators
it includes.,A range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by ,.  A
version matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least
one of the ,-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version.,For example, the range , would match the versions
,, ,, and ,, but not the versions ,, ,,
or ,.,The range , would match the versions ,,
,, and ,, but not the versions , or ,.,If a version has a prerelease tag (for example, ,) then
it will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one
comparator with the same , tuple also has a
prerelease tag.,For example, the range , would be allowed to match the
version ,, but it would , be satisfied by
,, even though , is technically ""greater
than"" , according to the SemVer sort rules.  The version
range only accepts prerelease tags on the , version.  The
version , , satisfy the range, because it does not have a
prerelease flag, and , is greater than ,.,The purpose for this behavior is twofold.  First, prerelease versions
frequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes
that are (by the author's design) not yet fit for public consumption.
Therefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching
semantics.,Second, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has
clearly indicated the intent to use , set of
alpha/beta/rc versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,
the user is indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it
is still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a
similar risk on the , set of prerelease versions.,Note that this behavior can be suppressed (treating all prerelease
versions as if they were normal versions, for the purpose of range
matching) by setting the , flag on the options
object to any
, that do
range matching.,The method , takes an additional , string argument that
will append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:,command-line example:,Which then can be used to increment further:,Advanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in
deterministic ways.,Advanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive
comparators using white space or ,.,Specifies an inclusive set.,If a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive
range, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.,If a partial version is provided as the second version in the
inclusive range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts
of the tuple are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the
provided tuple parts.,Any of ,, ,, or , may be used to ""stand in"" for one of the
numeric values in the , tuple.,A partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special
character is in fact optional.,Allows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the
comparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.,Allows changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero element in the
, tuple.  In other words, this allows patch and
minor updates for versions , and above, patch updates for
versions ,, and , updates for versions ,.,Many authors treat a , version as if the , were the major
""breaking-change"" indicator.,Caret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes
between , and , releases, which is a common practice.
However, it presumes that there will , be breaking changes between
, and ,.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be
additive (but non-breaking), according to commonly observed practices.,When parsing caret ranges, a missing , value desugars to the
number ,, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if the
major and minor versions are both ,.,A missing , and , values will desugar to zero, but also
allow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is
zero.,Putting all this together, here is a Backus-Naur grammar for ranges,
for the benefit of parser authors:,All methods and classes take a final , object argument.  All
options in this object are , by default.  The options supported
are:,Strict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer
strings that they parse.,Note that, since ranges may be non-contiguous, a version might not be
greater than a range, less than a range, , satisfy a range!  For
example, the range , would have a hole from ,
until ,, so the version , would not be greater than the
range (because , satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the
range (since , satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not
satisfy the range.,If you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a
range, use the , function.,This aims to provide a very forgiving translation of a non-semver string to
semver. It looks for the first digit in a string, and consumes all
remaining characters which satisfy at least a partial semver (e.g., ,,
,, ,) up to the max permitted length (256 characters).  Longer
versions are simply truncated (, becomes ,).  All
surrounding text is simply ignored (, becomes
,).  Only text which lacks digits will fail coercion (,
is not valid).  The maximum  length for any semver component considered for
coercion is 16 characters; longer components will be ignored
(, becomes ,).  The maximum value for any
semver component is ,; higher value
components are invalid (, is likely invalid).,If the , flag is set, then , will return the right-most
coercible tuple that does not share an ending index with a longer coercible
tuple.  For example, , will return , in rtl mode, not
,.  , will return ,, because the , is not a part of
any other overlapping SemVer tuple.,This will return a cleaned and trimmed semver version. If the provided
version is not valid a null will be returned. This does not work for
ranges.,ex.,You may pull in just the part of this semver utility that you need, if you
are sensitive to packing and tree-shaking concerns.  The main
, export uses getter functions to lazily load the parts
of the API that are used.,The following modules are available:,

The , has produced many impressive , as well as , for , itself.,The , command is extensively documented in its ,.,We can list all the existing passwords in the store:,And we can show passwords too:,Or copy them to the clipboard:,There will be a nice password input dialog using the standard , (which can be configured to stay authenticated for several minutes), since all passwords are encrypted.,We can add existing passwords to the store with ,:,This also handles multiline passwords or other data with , or ,, and passwords can be edited in your default text editor using ,.,The utility can , new passwords using , internally:,It's possible to generate passwords with no symbols using , or ,, and we can copy it to the clipboard instead of displaying it at the console using , or ,.,And of course, passwords can be removed:,If the password store is a git repository, since each manipulation creates a git commit, you can synchronize the password store using , and ,, which call , or , on the store.,You can read more examples and more features in the ,.,To begin, there is a single command to initialize the password store:,Here, , is the ID of my GPG key. You can use your standard GPG key or use an alternative one especially for the password store as shown above. Multiple GPG keys can be specified, for using pass in a team setting, and different folders can have different GPG keys, by using ,.,We can additionally initialize the password store as a git repository:,If a git repository is initialized, , creates a git commit each time the password store is manipulated.,There is a more , in the ,.,The latest version is 1.7.4.,The password store is available through the ,:,You may , or clone the repo:
,All releases are tagged, and the tags are signed with ,.,The password store does not impose any particular schema or type of organization of your data, as it is simply a flat text file, which can contain arbitrary data. Though the most common case is storing a single password per entry, some power users find they would like to store more than just their password inside the password store, and additionally store answers to secret questions, website URLs, and other sensitive information or metadata. Since the password store does not impose a scheme of it's own, you can choose your own organization. There are many possibilities.,One approach is to use the multi-line functionality of pass (, or , in ,), and store the password itself on the first line of the file, and the additional information on subsequent lines. For example, , might look like this:, The , / , options will only copy the first line of such a file to the clipboard, thereby making it easy to fetch the password for login forms, while retaining additional information in the same file.,Another approach is to use folders, and store each piece of data inside a file in that folder. For example , would hold bookreader's password inside the , directory, and , would hold a secret question, and , would hold something else related to bookreader's account. And yet another approach might be to store the password in , and the additional data in ,. And even another approach might be use multiline, as outlined above, but put the URL template in the filename instead of inside the file.,The point is, the possibilities here are extremely numerous, and there are many other organizational schemes not mentioned above; you have the freedom of choosing the one that fits your workflow best.,In order to faciliate the large variety of uses users come up with, , supports extensions. Extensions installed to , (or some distro-specific variety of such) are always enabled. Extensions installed to , are enabled if the , environment variable is , Read the , for more details.,The community has produced many such extensions:,The community has assembled an impressive list of clients and GUIs for various platforms:,To free password data from the clutches of other (bloated) password managers, various users have come up with different password store organizations that work best for them.

,GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of
media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple
Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video
(non-linear editing) processing.
,
Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology 
transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a
simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.
